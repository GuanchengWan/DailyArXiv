| **[AutoMind: Adaptive Knowledgeable Agent for Automated Data Science](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10974v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing real-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing work.

| **[PLAY2PROMPT: Zero-shot Tool Instruction Optimization for LLM Agents via Tool Play](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14432v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated with specialized external tools, yet many tasks demand zero-shot tool usage with minimal or noisy documentation. Existing solutions rely on manual rewriting or labeled data for validation, making them inapplicable in true zero-shot settings. To address these challenges, we propose PLAY2PROMPT, an automated framework that systematically "plays" with each tool to explore its input-output behaviors. Through this iterative trial-and-error process, PLAY2PROMPT refines tool documentation and generates usage examples without any labeled data. These examples not only guide LLM inference but also serve as validation to further enhance tool utilization. Extensive experiments on real-world tasks demonstrate that PLAY2PROMPT significantly improves zero-shot tool performance across both open and closed models, offering a scalable and effective solution for domain-specific tool integration.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 Long Paper (Findings)</p></details> |
| **[A Vision for Auto Research with LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18765v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces Agent-Based Auto Research, a structured multi-agent framework designed to automate, coordinate, and optimize the full lifecycle of scientific research. Leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and modular agent collaboration, the system spans all major research phases, including literature review, ideation, methodology planning, experimentation, paper writing, peer review response, and dissemination. By addressing issues such as fragmented workflows, uneven methodological expertise, and cognitive overload, the framework offers a systematic and scalable approach to scientific inquiry. Preliminary explorations demonstrate the feasibility and potential of Auto Research as a promising paradigm for self-improving, AI-driven research processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[OPT-BENCH: Evaluating LLM Agent on Large-Scale Search Spaces Optimization Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10764v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in solving diverse tasks. However, their proficiency in iteratively optimizing complex solutions through learning from previous feedback remains insufficiently explored. To bridge this gap, we present OPT-BENCH, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents on large-scale search space optimization problems. OPT-BENCH includes 20 real-world machine learning tasks sourced from Kaggle and 10 classical NP problems, offering a diverse and challenging environment for assessing LLM agents on iterative reasoning and solution refinement. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce OPT-Agent, an end-to-end optimization framework that emulates human reasoning when tackling complex problems by generating, validating, and iteratively improving solutions through leveraging historical feedback. Through extensive experiments on 9 state-of-the-art LLMs from 6 model families, we analyze the effects of optimization iterations, temperature settings, and model architectures on solution quality and convergence. Our results demonstrate that incorporating historical context significantly enhances optimization performance across both ML and NP tasks. All datasets, code, and evaluation tools are open-sourced to promote further research in advancing LLM-driven optimization and iterative reasoning.

| **[Specification and Evaluation of Multi-Agent LLM Systems -- Prototype and Cybersecurity Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10467v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in LLMs indicate potential for novel applications, e.g., through reasoning capabilities in the latest OpenAI and DeepSeek models. For applying these models in specific domains beyond text generation, LLM-based multi-agent approaches can be utilized that solve complex tasks by combining reasoning techniques, code generation, and software execution. Applications might utilize these capabilities and the knowledge of specialized LLM agents. However, while many evaluations are performed on LLMs, reasoning techniques, and applications individually, their joint specification and combined application is not explored well. Defined specifications for multi-agent LLM systems are required to explore their potential and their suitability for specific applications, allowing for systematic evaluations of LLMs, reasoning techniques, and related aspects. This paper reports the results of exploratory research to specify and evaluate these aspects through a multi-agent system. The system architecture and prototype are extended from previous research and a specification is introduced for multi-agent systems. Test cases involving cybersecurity tasks indicate feasibility of the architecture and evaluation approach. In particular, the results show the evaluation of question answering, server security, and network security tasks that were completed correctly by agents with LLMs from OpenAI and DeepSeek.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Automated but Risky Game: Modeling Agent-to-Agent Negotiations and Transactions in Consumer Markets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00073v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI agents are increasingly used in consumer-facing applications to assist with tasks such as product search, negotiation, and transaction execution. In this paper, we explore a future scenario where both consumers and merchants authorize AI agents to fully automate negotiations and transactions. We aim to answer two key questions: (1) Do different LLM agents vary in their ability to secure favorable deals for users? (2) What risks arise from fully automating deal-making with AI agents in consumer markets? To address these questions, we develop an experimental framework that evaluates the performance of various LLM agents in real-world negotiation and transaction settings. Our findings reveal that AI-mediated deal-making is an inherently imbalanced game -- different agents achieve significantly different outcomes for their users. Moreover, behavioral anomalies in LLMs can result in financial losses for both consumers and merchants, such as overspending or accepting unreasonable deals. These results underscore that while automation can improve efficiency, it also introduces substantial risks. Users should exercise caution when delegating business decisions to AI agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Provably Learning from Language Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10341v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interactively learning from observation and language feedback is an increasingly studied area driven by the emergence of large language model (LLM) agents. While impressive empirical demonstrations have been shown, so far a principled framing of these decision problems remains lacking. In this paper, we formalize the Learning from Language Feedback (LLF) problem, assert sufficient assumptions to enable learning despite latent rewards, and introduce $\textit{transfer eluder dimension}$ as a complexity measure to characterize the hardness of LLF problems. We show that transfer eluder dimension captures the intuition that information in the feedback changes the learning complexity of the LLF problem. We demonstrate cases where learning from rich language feedback can be exponentially faster than learning from reward. We develop a no-regret algorithm, called $\texttt{HELiX}$, that provably solves LLF problems through sequential interactions, with performance guarantees that scale with the transfer eluder dimension of the problem. Across several empirical domains, we show that $\texttt{HELiX}$ performs well even when repeatedly prompting LLMs does not work reliably. Our contributions mark a first step towards designing principled interactive learning algorithms from generic language feedback.</p></details> |  |
| **[Minimizing False Positives in Static Bug Detection via LLM-Enhanced Path Feasibility Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10322v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Static bug analyzers play a crucial role in ensuring software quality. However, existing analyzers for bug detection in large codebases often suffer from high false positive rates. This is primarily due to the limited capabilities of analyzers in path feasibility validation with multiple conditional branches and complex data dependencies. While current LLM-based approaches attempt to address this issue, their effectiveness remains limited due to insufficient constraint cascade analysis and scalability challenges in large projects. To address this challenge, we propose an iterative path feasibility analysis framework LLM4PFA. By leveraging LLM agent based targeted constraint reasoning, and key context-aware analysis driven by agent planning, LLM4PFA effectively enhances complex inter-procedural path feasibility analysis for minimizing false positives in static bug detection. Evaluation results show that LLM4PFA precisely filters out 72% to 96% false positives reported during static bug detection, significantly outperforming all the baselines by 41.1% - 105.7% improvements; meanwhile LLM4PFA only misses 3 real bugs of 45 true positives.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disclosure Audits for LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10171v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model agents have begun to appear as personal assistants, customer service bots, and clinical aides. While these applications deliver substantial operational benefits, they also require continuous access to sensitive data, which increases the likelihood of unauthorized disclosures. This study proposes an auditing framework for conversational privacy that quantifies and audits these risks. The proposed Conversational Manipulation for Privacy Leakage (CMPL) framework, is an iterative probing strategy designed to stress-test agents that enforce strict privacy directives. Rather than focusing solely on a single disclosure event, CMPL simulates realistic multi-turn interactions to systematically uncover latent vulnerabilities. Our evaluation on diverse domains, data modalities, and safety configurations demonstrate the auditing framework's ability to reveal privacy risks that are not deterred by existing single-turn defenses. In addition to introducing CMPL as a diagnostic tool, the paper delivers (1) an auditing procedure grounded in quantifiable risk metrics and (2) an open benchmark for evaluation of conversational privacy across agent implementations.</p></details> |  |
| **[DAWN: Designing Distributed Agents in a Worldwide Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22339v3)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed them from basic conversational tools into sophisticated entities capable of complex reasoning and decision-making. These advancements have led to the development of specialized LLM-based agents designed for diverse tasks such as coding and web browsing. As these agents become more capable, the need for a robust framework that facilitates global communication and collaboration among them towards advanced objectives has become increasingly critical. Distributed Agents in a Worldwide Network (DAWN) addresses this need by offering a versatile framework that integrates LLM-based agents with traditional software systems, enabling the creation of agentic applications suited for a wide range of use cases. DAWN enables distributed agents worldwide to register and be easily discovered through Gateway Agents. Collaborations among these agents are coordinated by a Principal Agent equipped with reasoning strategies. DAWN offers three operational modes: No-LLM Mode for deterministic tasks, Copilot for augmented decision-making, and LLM Agent for autonomous operations. Additionally, DAWN ensures the safety and security of agent collaborations globally through a dedicated safety, security, and compliance layer, protecting the network against attackers and adhering to stringent security and compliance standards. These features make DAWN a robust network for deploying agent-based applications across various industries.</p></details> |  |
| **[A quantum semantic framework for natural language processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10077v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic degeneracy represents a fundamental property of natural language that extends beyond simple polysemy to encompass the combinatorial explosion of potential interpretations that emerges as semantic expressions increase in complexity. Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face inherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language itself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by semantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as an expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent (human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This computational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms possess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that meaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act. To test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM agents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs under varied contextual settings. Across several independent experiments, we found average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several runs yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical boundary ($|S|\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under ambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from human cognition experiments. These results inherently imply that classical frequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are necessarily lossy. Instead, we propose that Bayesian-style repeated sampling approaches can provide more practically useful and appropriate characterizations of linguistic meaning in context.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, accepted submission to Quantum AI and NLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Design Patterns for Securing LLM Agents against Prompt Injections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08837v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly versatile and capable of addressing a broad spectrum of tasks, ensuring their security has become a critical challenge. Among the most pressing threats are prompt injection attacks, which exploit the agent's resilience on natural language inputs -- an especially dangerous threat when agents are granted tool access or handle sensitive information. In this work, we propose a set of principled design patterns for building AI agents with provable resistance to prompt injection. We systematically analyze these patterns, discuss their trade-offs in terms of utility and security, and illustrate their real-world applicability through a series of case studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedChat: A Multi-Agent Framework for Multimodal Diagnosis with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07400v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of deep learning-based glaucoma detection with large language models (LLMs) presents an automated strategy to mitigate ophthalmologist shortages and improve clinical reporting efficiency. However, applying general LLMs to medical imaging remains challenging due to hallucinations, limited interpretability, and insufficient domain-specific medical knowledge, which can potentially reduce clinical accuracy. Although recent approaches combining imaging models with LLM reasoning have improved reporting, they typically rely on a single generalist agent, restricting their capacity to emulate the diverse and complex reasoning found in multidisciplinary medical teams. To address these limitations, we propose MedChat, a multi-agent diagnostic framework and platform that combines specialized vision models with multiple role-specific LLM agents, all coordinated by a director agent. This design enhances reliability, reduces hallucination risk, and enables interactive diagnostic reporting through an interface tailored for clinical review and educational use.

| **[TAMO:Fine-Grained Root Cause Analysis via Tool-Assisted LLM Agent with Multi-Modality Observation Data in Cloud-Native Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20462v3)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the development of distributed systems, microservices and cloud native technologies have become central to modern enterprise software development. Despite bringing significant advantages, these technologies also increase system complexity and operational challenges. Traditional root cause analysis (RCA) struggles to achieve automated fault response, heavily relying on manual intervention. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made breakthroughs in contextual inference and domain knowledge integration, providing new solutions for Artificial Intelligence for Operations (AIOps). However, Existing LLM-based approaches face three key challenges: text input constraints, dynamic service dependency hallucinations, and context window limitations. To address these issues, we propose a tool-assisted LLM agent with multi-modality observation data, namely TAMO, for fine-grained RCA. It unifies multi-modal observational data into time-aligned representations to extract consistent features and employs specialized root cause localization and fault classification tools for perceiving the contextual environment. This approach overcomes the limitations of LLM in handling real-time changing service dependencies and raw observational data and guides LLM to generate repair strategies aligned with system contexts by structuring key information into a prompt. Experimental results show that TAMO performs well in root cause analysis when dealing with public datasets characterized by heterogeneity and common fault types, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving LLM Agent Planning with In-Context Learning via Atomic Fact Augmentation and Lookahead Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09171v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly capable but often require significant guidance or extensive interaction history to perform effectively in complex, interactive environments. Existing methods may struggle with adapting to new information or efficiently utilizing past experiences for multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning. We introduce a novel LLM agent framework that enhances planning capabilities through in-context learning, facilitated by atomic fact augmentation and a recursive lookahead search. Our agent learns to extract task-critical ``atomic facts'' from its interaction trajectories. These facts dynamically augment the prompts provided to LLM-based components responsible for action proposal, latent world model simulation, and state-value estimation. Planning is performed via a depth-limited lookahead search, where the LLM simulates potential trajectories and evaluates their outcomes, guided by the accumulated facts and interaction history. This approach allows the agent to improve its understanding and decision-making online, leveraging its experience to refine its behavior without weight updates. We provide a theoretical motivation linking performance to the quality of fact-based abstraction and LLM simulation accuracy. Empirically, our agent demonstrates improved performance and adaptability on challenging interactive tasks, achieving more optimal behavior as it accumulates experience, showcased in tasks such as TextFrozenLake and ALFWorld.</p></details> | <details><summary>9-pag...</summary><p>9-page main paper, 1 figure.

| **[MELON: Provable Defense Against Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks in AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05174v4)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has explored that LLM agents are vulnerable to indirect prompt injection (IPI) attacks, where malicious tasks embedded in tool-retrieved information can redirect the agent to take unauthorized actions. Existing defenses against IPI have significant limitations: either require essential model training resources, lack effectiveness against sophisticated attacks, or harm the normal utilities. We present MELON (Masked re-Execution and TooL comparisON), a novel IPI defense. Our approach builds on the observation that under a successful attack, the agent's next action becomes less dependent on user tasks and more on malicious tasks. Following this, we design MELON to detect attacks by re-executing the agent's trajectory with a masked user prompt modified through a masking function. We identify an attack if the actions generated in the original and masked executions are similar. We also include three key designs to reduce the potential false positives and false negatives. Extensive evaluation on the IPI benchmark AgentDojo demonstrates that MELON outperforms SOTA defenses in both attack prevention and utility preservation. Moreover, we show that combining MELON with a SOTA prompt augmentation defense (denoted as MELON-Aug) further improves its performance. We also conduct a detailed ablation study to validate our key designs. Code is available at https://github.com/kaijiezhu11/MELON.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[DefenderBench: A Toolkit for Evaluating Language Agents in Cybersecurity Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00739v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents have shown impressive capabilities in human language comprehension and reasoning, yet their potential in cybersecurity remains underexplored. We introduce DefenderBench, a practical, open-source toolkit for evaluating language agents across offense, defense, and cybersecurity knowledge-based tasks. DefenderBench includes environments for network intrusion, malicious content detection, code vulnerability analysis, and cybersecurity knowledge assessment. It is intentionally designed to be affordable and easily accessible for researchers while providing fair and rigorous assessment. We benchmark several state-of-the-art (SoTA) and popular LLMs, including both open- and closed-weight models, using a standardized agentic framework. Our results show that Claude-3.7-sonnet performs best with a DefenderBench score of 81.65, followed by Claude-3.7-sonnet-think with 78.40, while the best open-weight model, Llama 3.3 70B, is not far behind with a DefenderBench score of 71.81. DefenderBench's modular design allows seamless integration of custom LLMs and tasks, promoting reproducibility and fair comparisons. An anonymized version of DefenderBench is available at https://github.com/microsoft/DefenderBench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Measuring Data Science Automation: A Survey of Evaluation Tools for AI Assistants and Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08800v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data science aims to extract insights from data to support decision-making processes. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as assistants for data science, by suggesting ideas, techniques and small code snippets, or for the interpretation of results and reporting. Proper automation of some data-science activities is now promised by the rise of LLM agents, i.e., AI systems powered by an LLM equipped with additional affordances--such as code execution and knowledge bases--that can perform self-directed actions and interact with digital environments. In this paper, we survey the evaluation of LLM assistants and agents for data science. We find (1) a dominant focus on a small subset of goal-oriented activities, largely ignoring data management and exploratory activities; (2) a concentration on pure assistance or fully autonomous agents, without considering intermediate levels of human-AI collaboration; and (3) an emphasis on human substitution, therefore neglecting the possibility of higher levels of automation thanks to task transformation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved LLM Agents for Financial Document Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08726v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities on numerous natural language processing tasks. However, LLMs still struggle with numerical question answering for financial documents that include tabular and textual data. Recent works have showed the effectiveness of critic agents (i.e., self-correction) for this task given oracle labels. Building upon this framework, this paper examines the effectiveness of the traditional critic agent when oracle labels are not available, and show, through experiments, that this critic agent's performance deteriorates in this scenario. With this in mind, we present an improved critic agent, along with the calculator agent which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approach (program-of-thought) and is safer. Furthermore, we investigate how our agents interact with each other, and how this interaction affects their performance.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Understanding Bias Reinforcement in LLM Agents Debate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16814v3)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models $($LLMs$)$ solve complex problems using training-free methods like prompt engineering and in-context learning, yet ensuring reasoning correctness remains challenging. While self-correction methods such as self-consistency and self-refinement aim to improve reliability, they often reinforce biases due to the lack of effective feedback mechanisms. Multi-Agent Debate $($MAD$)$ has emerged as an alternative, but we identify two key limitations: bias reinforcement, where debate amplifies model biases instead of correcting them, and lack of perspective diversity, as all agents share the same model and reasoning patterns, limiting true debate effectiveness. To systematically evaluate these issues, we introduce $\textit{MetaNIM Arena}$, a benchmark designed to assess LLMs in adversarial strategic decision-making, where dynamic interactions influence optimal decisions. To overcome MAD's limitations, we propose $\textbf{DReaMAD}$ $($$\textbf{D}$iverse $\textbf{Rea}$soning via $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{A}$gent $\textbf{D}$ebate with Refined Prompt$)$, a novel framework that $(1)$ refines LLM's strategic prior knowledge to improve reasoning quality and $(2)$ promotes diverse viewpoints within a single model by systematically modifying prompts, reducing bias. Empirical results show that $\textbf{DReaMAD}$ significantly improves decision accuracy, reasoning diversity, and bias mitigation across multiple strategic tasks, establishing it as a more effective approach for LLM-based decision-making.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[CrimeMind: Simulating Urban Crime with Multi-Modal LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05981v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling urban crime is an important yet challenging task that requires understanding the subtle visual, social, and cultural cues embedded in urban environments. Previous work has mainly focused on rule-based agent-based modeling (ABM) and deep learning methods. ABMs offer interpretability of internal mechanisms but exhibit limited predictive accuracy. In contrast, deep learning methods are often effective in prediction but are less interpretable and require extensive training data. Moreover, both lines of work lack the cognitive flexibility to adapt to changing environments. Leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), we propose CrimeMind, a novel LLM-driven ABM framework for simulating urban crime within a multi-modal urban context. A key innovation of our design is the integration of the Routine Activity Theory (RAT) into the agentic workflow of CrimeMind, enabling it to process rich multi-modal urban features and reason about criminal behavior. However, RAT requires LLM agents to infer subtle cues in evaluating environmental safety as part of assessing guardianship, which can be challenging for LLMs. To address this, we collect a small-scale human-annotated dataset and align CrimeMind's perception with human judgment via a training-free textual gradient method. Experiments across four major U.S. cities demonstrate that CrimeMind outperforms both traditional ABMs and deep learning baselines in crime hotspot prediction and spatial distribution accuracy, achieving up to a 24% improvement over the strongest baseline. Furthermore, we conduct counterfactual simulations of external incidents and policy interventions and it successfully captures the expected changes in crime patterns, demonstrating its ability to reflect counterfactual scenarios. Overall, CrimeMind enables fine-grained modeling of individual behaviors and facilitates evaluation of real-world interventions.</p></details> | Typos corrected |
| **[SOP-Bench: Complex Industrial SOPs for Evaluating LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08119v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive general-purpose reasoning and problem-solving abilities. However, they struggle with executing complex, long-horizon workflows that demand strict adherence to Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), a critical requirement for real-world industrial automation. Despite this need, there is a lack of public benchmarks that reflect the complexity, structure, and domain-specific nuances of SOPs. To address this, we present three main contributions. First, we introduce a synthetic data generation framework to create realistic, industry-grade SOPs that rigorously test the planning, reasoning, and tool-use capabilities of LLM-based agents. Second, using this framework, we develop SOP-Bench, a benchmark of over 1,800 tasks across 10 industrial domains, each with APIs, tool interfaces, and human-validated test cases. Third, we evaluate two prominent agent architectures: Function-Calling and ReAct Agents, on SOP-Bench, observing average success rates of only 27% and 48%, respectively. Remarkably, when the tool registry is much larger than necessary, agents invoke incorrect tools nearly 100% of the time. These findings underscore a substantial gap between current agentic capabilities of LLMs and the demands of automating real-world SOPs. Performance varies significantly by task and domain, highlighting the need for domain-specific benchmarking and architectural choices before deployment. SOP-Bench is publicly available at http://sop-bench.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/. We also release the prompts underpinning the data generation framework to support new domain-specific SOP benchmarks. We invite the community to extend SOP-Bench with SOPs from their industrial domains.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Beyond Numeric Rewards: In-Context Dueling Bandits with LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01887v4)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) is a frontier paradigm to solve Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems in the foundation model era. While ICRL capabilities have been demonstrated in transformers through task-specific training, the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) out-of-the-box remains largely unexplored. This paper investigates whether LLMs can generalize cross-domain to perform ICRL under the problem of Dueling Bandits (DB), a stateless preference-based RL setting. We find that the top-performing LLMs exhibit a notable zero-shot capacity for relative decision-making, which translates to low short-term weak regret across all DB environment instances by quickly including the best arm in duels. However, an optimality gap still exists between LLMs and classic DB algorithms in terms of strong regret. LLMs struggle to converge and consistently exploit even when explicitly prompted to do so, and are sensitive to prompt variations. To bridge this gap, we propose an agentic flow framework: LLM with Enhanced Algorithmic Dueling (LEAD), which integrates off-the-shelf DB algorithm support with LLM agents through fine-grained adaptive interplay. We show that LEAD has theoretical guarantees inherited from classic DB algorithms on both weak and strong regret. We validate its efficacy and robustness even with noisy and adversarial prompts. The design of such an agentic framework sheds light on how to enhance the trustworthiness of general-purpose LLMs generalized to in-context decision-making tasks.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |
| **[QUITE: A Query Rewrite System Beyond Rules with LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07675v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Query rewrite transforms SQL queries into semantically equivalent forms that run more efficiently. Existing approaches mainly rely on predefined rewrite rules, but they handle a limited subset of queries and can cause performance regressions. This limitation stems from three challenges of rule-based query rewrite: (1) it is hard to discover and verify new rules, (2) fixed rewrite rules do not generalize to new query patterns, and (3) some rewrite techniques cannot be expressed as fixed rules. Motivated by the fact that human experts exhibit significantly better rewrite ability but suffer from scalability, and Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated nearly human-level semantic and reasoning abilities, we propose a new approach of using LLMs to rewrite SQL queries beyond rules. Due to the hallucination problems in LLMs, directly applying LLMs often leads to nonequivalent and suboptimal queries. To address this issue, we propose QUITE (query rewrite), a training-free and feedback-aware system based on LLM agents that rewrites SQL queries into semantically equivalent forms with significantly better performance, covering a broader range of query patterns and rewrite strategies compared to rule-based methods. Firstly, we design a multi-agent framework controlled by a finite state machine (FSM) to equip LLMs with the ability to use external tools and enhance the rewrite process with real-time database feedback. Secondly, we develop a rewrite middleware to enhance the ability of LLMs to generate optimized query equivalents. Finally, we employ a novel hint injection technique to improve execution plans for rewritten queries. Extensive experiments show that QUITE reduces query execution time by up to 35.8% over state-of-the-art approaches and produces 24.1% more rewrites than prior methods, covering query cases that earlier systems did not handle.</p></details> |  |
| **[IntenTest: Stress Testing for Intent Integrity in API-Calling LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07524v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM agents are increasingly deployed to automate real-world tasks by invoking APIs through natural language instructions. While powerful, they often suffer from misinterpretation of user intent, leading to the agent's actions that diverge from the user's intended goal, especially as external toolkits evolve. Traditional software testing assumes structured inputs and thus falls short in handling the ambiguity of natural language. We introduce IntenTest, an API-centric stress testing framework that systematically uncovers intent integrity violations in LLM agents. Unlike prior work focused on fixed benchmarks or adversarial inputs, IntenTest generates realistic tasks based on toolkits' documentation and applies targeted mutations to expose subtle agent errors while preserving user intent. To guide testing, we propose semantic partitioning, which organizes natural language tasks into meaningful categories based on toolkit API parameters and their equivalence classes. Within each partition, seed tasks are mutated and ranked by a lightweight predictor that estimates the likelihood of triggering agent errors. To enhance efficiency, IntenTest maintains a datatype-aware strategy memory that retrieves and adapts effective mutation patterns from past cases. Experiments on 80 toolkit APIs demonstrate that IntenTest effectively uncovers intent integrity violations, significantly outperforming baselines in both error-exposing rate and query efficiency. Moreover, IntenTest generalizes well to stronger target models using smaller LLMs for test generation, and adapts to evolving APIs across domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Strategic Language Agents in the Werewolf Game with Iterative Latent Space Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04686v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in various domains like open-ended conversation and multi-step decision-making. However, it remains challenging for these agents to solve strategic language games, such as Werewolf, which demand both strategic decision-making and free-form language interactions. Existing LLM agents often suffer from intrinsic bias in their action distributions and limited exploration of the unbounded text action space, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose Latent Space Policy Optimization (LSPO), an iterative framework that combines game-theoretic methods with LLM fine-tuning to build strategic language agents. LSPO leverages the observation that while the language space is combinatorially large, the underlying strategy space is relatively compact. We first map free-form utterances into a finite latent strategy space, yielding an abstracted extensive-form game. Then we apply game-theoretic methods like Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) to optimize the policy in the latent space. Finally, we fine-tune the LLM via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align with the learned policy. By iteratively alternating between these steps, our LSPO agents progressively enhance both strategic reasoning and language communication. Experiment on the Werewolf game shows that our agents iteratively expand the strategy space with improving performance and outperform existing Werewolf agents, underscoring their effectiveness in free-form language games with strategic interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ICML 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we examine whether sociolect usage by an LLM agent affects user reliance on its outputs and user perception (satisfaction, frustration, trust, and social presence). We designed and conducted user studies where 498 African American English (AAE) speakers and 487 Queer slang speakers performed a set of question-answering tasks with LLM-based suggestions in either standard American English (SAE) or their self-identified sociolect. Our findings showed that sociolect usage by LLMs influenced both reliance and perceptions, though in some surprising ways. Results suggest that both AAE and Queer slang speakers relied more on the SAE agent, and had more positive perceptions of the SAE agent. Yet, only Queer slang speakers felt more social presence from the Queer slang agent over the SAE one, whereas only AAE speakers preferred and trusted the SAE agent over the AAE one. These findings emphasize the need to test for behavioral outcomes rather than simply assume that personalization would lead to a better and safer reliance outcome. They also highlight the nuanced dynamics of minoritized language in machine interactions, underscoring the need for LLMs to be carefully designed to respect cultural and linguistic boundaries while fostering genuine user engagement and trust.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to FAccT 2025</p></details> |
| **[G-Memory: Tracing Hierarchical Memory for Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07398v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) have demonstrated cognitive and execution capabilities that far exceed those of single LLM agents, yet their capacity for self-evolution remains hampered by underdeveloped memory architectures. Upon close inspection, we are alarmed to discover that prevailing MAS memory mechanisms (1) are overly simplistic, completely disregarding the nuanced inter-agent collaboration trajectories, and (2) lack cross-trial and agent-specific customization, in stark contrast to the expressive memory developed for single agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce G-Memory, a hierarchical, agentic memory system for MAS inspired by organizational memory theory, which manages the lengthy MAS interaction via a three-tier graph hierarchy: insight, query, and interaction graphs. Upon receiving a new user query, G-Memory performs bi-directional memory traversal to retrieve both $\textit{high-level, generalizable insights}$ that enable the system to leverage cross-trial knowledge, and $\textit{fine-grained, condensed interaction trajectories}$ that compactly encode prior collaboration experiences. Upon task execution, the entire hierarchy evolves by assimilating new collaborative trajectories, nurturing the progressive evolution of agent teams. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks, three LLM backbones, and three popular MAS frameworks demonstrate that G-Memory improves success rates in embodied action and accuracy in knowledge QA by up to $20.89\%$ and $10.12\%$, respectively, without any modifications to the original frameworks.

| **[Shapley-Coop: Credit Assignment for Emergent Cooperation in Self-Interested LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07388v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong collaborative performance in multi-agent systems with predefined roles and workflows. However, in open-ended environments lacking coordination rules, agents tend to act in self-interested ways. The central challenge in achieving coordination lies in credit assignment -- fairly evaluating each agent's contribution and designing pricing mechanisms that align their heterogeneous goals. This problem is critical as LLMs increasingly participate in complex human-AI collaborations, where fair compensation and accountability rely on effective pricing mechanisms. Inspired by how human societies address similar coordination challenges (e.g., through temporary collaborations such as employment or subcontracting), we propose a cooperative workflow, Shapley-Coop. Shapley-Coop integrates Shapley Chain-of-Thought -- leveraging marginal contributions as a principled basis for pricing -- with structured negotiation protocols for effective price matching, enabling LLM agents to coordinate through rational task-time pricing and post-task reward redistribution. This approach aligns agent incentives, fosters cooperation, and maintains autonomy. We evaluate Shapley-Coop across two multi-agent games and a software engineering simulation, demonstrating that it consistently enhances LLM agent collaboration and facilitates equitable credit assignment. These results highlight the effectiveness of Shapley-Coop's pricing mechanisms in accurately reflecting individual contributions during task execution.</p></details> |  |
| **[SyncMind: Measuring Agent Out-of-Sync Recovery in Collaborative Software Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06994v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software engineering (SE) is increasingly collaborative, with developers working together on shared complex codebases. Effective collaboration in shared environments requires participants -- whether humans or AI agents -- to stay on the same page as their environment evolves. When a collaborator's understanding diverges from the current state -- what we term the out-of-sync challenge -- the collaborator's actions may fail, leading to integration issues. In this work, we introduce SyncMind, a framework that systematically defines the out-of-sync problem faced by large language model (LLM) agents in collaborative software engineering (CSE). Based on SyncMind, we create SyncBench, a benchmark featuring 24,332 instances of agent out-of-sync scenarios in real-world CSE derived from 21 popular GitHub repositories with executable verification tests. Experiments on SyncBench uncover critical insights into existing LLM agents' capabilities and limitations. Besides substantial performance gaps among agents (from Llama-3.1 agent <= 3.33% to Claude-3.5-Sonnet >= 28.18%), their consistently low collaboration willingness (<= 4.86%) suggests fundamental limitations of existing LLM in CSE. However, when collaboration occurs, it positively correlates with out-of-sync recovery success. Minimal performance differences in agents' resource-aware out-of-sync recoveries further reveal their significant lack of resource awareness and adaptability, shedding light on future resource-efficient collaborative systems. Code and data are openly available on our project website: https://xhguo7.github.io/SyncMind/.</p></details> |  |
| **[AlphaAgent: LLM-Driven Alpha Mining with Regularized Exploration to Counteract Alpha Decay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16789v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alpha mining, a critical component in quantitative investment, focuses on discovering predictive signals for future asset returns in increasingly complex financial markets. However, the pervasive issue of alpha decay, where factors lose their predictive power over time, poses a significant challenge for alpha mining. Traditional methods like genetic programming face rapid alpha decay from overfitting and complexity, while approaches driven by Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their promise, often rely too heavily on existing knowledge, creating homogeneous factors that worsen crowding and accelerate decay. To address this challenge, we propose AlphaAgent, an autonomous framework that effectively integrates LLM agents with ad hoc regularizations for mining decay-resistant alpha factors. AlphaAgent employs three key mechanisms: (i) originality enforcement through a similarity measure based on abstract syntax trees (ASTs) against existing alphas, (ii) hypothesis-factor alignment via LLM-evaluated semantic consistency between market hypotheses and generated factors, and (iii) complexity control via AST-based structural constraints, preventing over-engineered constructions that are prone to overfitting. These mechanisms collectively guide the alpha generation process to balance originality, financial rationale, and adaptability to evolving market conditions, mitigating the risk of alpha decay. Extensive evaluations show that AlphaAgent outperforms traditional and LLM-based methods in mitigating alpha decay across bull and bear markets, consistently delivering significant alpha in Chinese CSI 500 and US S&P 500 markets over the past four years. Notably, AlphaAgent showcases remarkable resistance to alpha decay, elevating the potential for yielding powerful factors.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages; Code is available at: https://github.com/RndmVariableQ/AlphaAgent</p></details> |

This paper introduces a mathematical model for quantifying the levels of civilization development and further employs a state transition matrix approach to evaluate their trajectories. Through this methodology, our study quantitatively analyzes the growth trajectories of civilizations, providing insights into future decision-making at critical points of growth and saturation. Furthermore, this paper acknowledges the vast diversity of potential living conditions across the universe, which could foster unique cosmologies, ethical codes, and worldviews among different civilizations. Recognizing the Earth-centric bias inherent in current LLM designs, we propose the novel concept of using LLM agents with diverse ethical paradigms and simulating interactions between entities with distinct moral principles. This innovative research not only introduces a novel method for comprehending potential inter-civilizational dynamics but also holds practical value in enabling entities with divergent value systems to strategize, prevent conflicts, and engage in games under conditions of asymmetric information.

| **[Learn as Individuals, Evolve as a Team: Multi-agent LLMs Adaptation in Embodied Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07232v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive knowledge bases and strong reasoning capabilities, making them promising tools for complex, multi-agent planning in embodied environments. However, despite LLMs' advanced abilities and the sophisticated modular design of agentic methods, existing LLM-based planning algorithms remain limited by weak adaptation capabilities to multi-agent embodied scenarios. We address this limitation by introducing a framework that enables LLM agents to learn and evolve both before and during test time, equipping them with environment-relevant knowledge for better planning and enhanced communication for improved cooperation. Inspired by centralized training with decentralized execution in multi-agent reinforcement learning, we propose a \textit{Learn as Individuals, Evolve as a Team (LIET)} paradigm for multi-agent LLMs adaptation. At the individual level, LLM agents learn a local utility function from exploratory datasets to better comprehend the embodied environment, which is then queried during test time to support informed decision-making. At the team level, LLM agents collaboratively and iteratively maintain and update a shared cooperation knowledge list based on new experiences, using it to guide more effective communication. By combining individual learning with team evolution, LIET enables comprehensive and flexible adaptation for LLM agents. Our experiments on Communicative Watch-And-Help and ThreeD-World Multi-Agent Transport benchmarks demonstrate that LIET, instantiated with both LLaMA and GPT-4o, outperforms existing baselines and exhibits strong cooperative planning abilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hallucination to Consensus: Multi-Agent LLMs for End-to-End Test Generation with Accurate Oracles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02943v3)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit testing plays a critical role in ensuring software correctness. However, writing unit tests manually is laborious, especially for strong typed languages like Java, motivating the need for automated approaches. Traditional methods primarily rely on search-based or randomized algorithms to generate tests that achieve high code coverage and produce regression oracles, which are derived from the program's current behavior rather than its intended functionality. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled oracle generation from natural language descriptions. However, existing LLM-based methods often require LLM fine-tuning or rely on external tools such as EvoSuite for test prefix generation. In this work, we propose CANDOR, a novel end-to-end, prompt-based LLM framework for automated JUnit test generation. CANDOR orchestrates multiple specialized LLM agents to generate JUnit tests, including both high-quality test prefixes and accurate oracles. To mitigate the notorious hallucinations in LLMs, we introduce a novel strategy that engages multiple reasoning LLMs in a panel discussion and generate accurate oracles based on consensus. Additionally, to reduce the verbosity of reasoning LLMs' outputs, we propose a novel dual-LLM pipeline to produce concise and structured oracle evaluations. Our experiments on the HumanEvalJava and LeetCodeJava datasets show that CANDOR can generate accurate oracles and is slightly better than EvoSuite in generating tests with high line coverage and clearly superior in terms of mutation score. Moreover, CANDOR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art, prompt-based test generator LLM-Empirical, achieving improvements of 15.8 to 25.1 percentage points in oracle correctness on both correct and faulty source code. Ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of key agents in improving test prefix quality and oracle accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolution of Cooperation in LLM-Agent Societies: A Preliminary Study Using Different Punishment Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19487v2)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of cooperation has been extensively studied using abstract mathematical models and simulations. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLM) and the rise of LLM agents have demonstrated their ability to perform social reasoning, thus providing an opportunity to test the emergence of norms in more realistic agent-based simulations with human-like reasoning using natural language. In this research, we investigate whether the cooperation dynamics presented in Boyd and Richerson's model persist in a more realistic simulation of the diner's dilemma using LLM agents compared to the abstract mathematical nature in the work of Boyd and Richerson. Our findings indicate that agents follow the strategies defined in the Boyd and Richerson model, and explicit punishment mechanisms drive norm emergence, reinforcing cooperative behaviour even when the agent strategy configuration varies. Our results suggest that LLM-based Multi-Agent System simulations, in fact, can replicate the evolution of cooperation predicted by the traditional mathematical models. Moreover, our simulations extend beyond the mathematical models by integrating natural language-driven reasoning and a pairwise imitation method for strategy adoption, making them a more realistic testbed for cooperative behaviour in MASs.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 10 figures, Accepted for presentation as a full paper at the COINE 2025 workshop at AAMAS 2025 (https://coin-workshop.github.io/coine-2025-detroit/accepted_for_presentation.html)</p></details> |

Our benchmarks consist of decision-making tasks derived from key problems in economics. To forestall saturation, the benchmark tasks are synthetically generated with scalable difficulty levels. Additionally, we propose litmus tests, a new kind of quantitative measure for LLMs and LLM agents. Unlike benchmarks, litmus tests quantify differences in character, values, and tendencies of LLMs and LLM agents, by considering their behavior when faced with tradeoffs (e.g., efficiency versus equality) where there is no objectively right or wrong behavior. Overall, our benchmarks and litmus tests assess the abilities and tendencies of LLM agents in tackling complex economic problems in diverse settings spanning procurement, scheduling, task allocation, and pricing -- applications that should grow in importance as such agents are further integrated into the economy.</p></details> |  |

To address the rarity issue, adversarial scenario generation methods are developed, in which behaviors of traffic participants are manipulated to induce safety-critical events. However, existing methods still face two limitations. First, identification of the adversarial participant directly impacts the effectiveness of the generation. However, the complexity of real-world scenarios, with numerous participants and diverse behaviors, makes identification challenging. Second, the potential of generated safety-critical scenarios to continuously improve ADS performance remains underexplored. To address these issues, we propose LLM-attacker: a closed-loop adversarial scenario generation framework leveraging large language models (LLMs). Specifically, multiple LLM agents are designed and coordinated to identify optimal attackers. Then, the trajectories of the attackers are optimized to generate adversarial scenarios. These scenarios are iteratively refined based on the performance of ADS, forming a feedback loop to improve ADS. Experimental results show that LLM-attacker can create more dangerous scenarios than other methods, and the ADS trained with it achieves a collision rate half that of training with normal scenarios. This indicates the ability of LLM-attacker to test and enhance the safety and robustness of ADS.

By constructing thousands of LLM Agents equipped with modules for personal characteristics, prior expectations, and knowledge, we replicate a survey experiment involving households and experts on inflation and unemployment. Our results show that although the expectations and thoughts generated by LLM Agents are more homogeneous than those of human participants, they still effectively capture key heterogeneity across agents and the underlying drivers of expectation formation. Furthermore, a module-ablation exercise highlights the critical role of prior expectations in simulating such heterogeneity. This approach complements traditional survey methods and offers new insights into AI behavioral science in macroeconomic research.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, current LLM agents are not designed to continually learn from past experiences during inference time, which could be crucial for them to gain these environment-specific experiences. To address this, we propose Contextual Experience Replay (CER), a training-free framework to enable efficient self-improvement for language agents in their context window. Specifically, CER accumulates and synthesizes past experiences into a dynamic memory buffer. These experiences encompass environment dynamics and common decision-making patterns, allowing the agents to retrieve and augment themselves with relevant knowledge in new tasks, enhancing their adaptability in complex environments. We evaluate CER on the challenging WebArena and VisualWebArena benchmarks. On VisualWebArena, CER achieves a competitive performance of 31.9%. On WebArena, CER also gets a competitive average success rate of 36.7%, relatively improving the success rate of the GPT-4o agent baseline by 51.0%. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis on it to prove its efficiency, validity and understand it better.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025. 20 pages</p></details> |

The advanced VAPO framework, despite sophisticated mechanisms like Decoupled GAE, theoretically faces fundamental limitations in comprehensively modeling and leveraging deep, long-term value for fine-grained, step-by-step policy guidance in extended reasoning chains. We argue these limitations stem from inherent difficulties in credit assignment, value function representational capacity with temporally abstracted goals, and translating global value signals into local policy improvements, especially with sparse rewards. Our theoretical analysis examines these aspects to illuminate VAPO's boundaries in long-term value modeling, aiming to deepen understanding of current RL for advanced reasoning and suggest future research for more robust LLM agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Bad e...</summary><p>Bad experiments, lacking sufficient references</p></details> |

Despite their potential, current LLM agents often adopt a one-size-fits-all approach, lacking the flexibility to respond to users' varying needs and preferences. This limitation motivates us to develop PersonaAgent, the first personalized LLM agent framework designed to address versatile personalization tasks. Specifically, PersonaAgent integrates two complementary components - a personalized memory module that includes episodic and semantic memory mechanisms; a personalized action module that enables the agent to perform tool actions tailored to the user. At the core, the persona (defined as unique system prompt for each user) functions as an intermediary: it leverages insights from personalized memory to control agent actions, while the outcomes of these actions in turn refine the memory. Based on the framework, we propose a test-time user-preference alignment strategy that simulate the latest n interactions to optimize the persona prompt, ensuring real-time user preference alignment through textual loss feedback between simulated and ground-truth responses. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that PersonaAgent significantly outperforms other baseline methods by not only personalizing the action space effectively but also scaling during test-time real-world applications. These results underscore the feasibility and potential of our approach in delivering tailored, dynamic user experiences.</p></details> |  |

We analyze current LLM capabilities for physics -- from mathematical reasoning to code generation -- identifying critical gaps in physical intuition, constraint satisfaction, and reliable reasoning. We envision future physics-specialized LLMs that could handle multimodal data, propose testable hypotheses, and design experiments. Realizing this vision requires addressing fundamental challenges: ensuring physical consistency, and developing robust verification methods.

However, designing high-performing agentic systems remains challenging. Existing agent search methods suffer from three major limitations: (1) an emphasis on optimizing agentic workflows while under-utilizing proven human-designed components such as memory, planning, and tool use; (2) high evaluation costs, as each newly generated agent must be fully evaluated on benchmarks; and (3) inefficient search in large search space. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive framework to address these challenges. First, We propose a hierarchical search space that jointly models agentic workflow and composable functional components, enabling richer agentic system designs. Building on this structured design space, we introduce a predictive value model that estimates agent performance given agentic system and task description, allowing for efficient, low-cost evaluation during the search process. Finally, we present a hierarchical Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) strategy informed by uncertainty to guide the search. Experiments on seven benchmarks, covering embodied, math, web, tool, and game, show that our method achieves an average performance gain of 8.34\% over state-of-the-art baselines and exhibits faster search progress with steeper improvement trajectories.

Existing AutoML systems often require technical expertise to set up complex tools, which is in general time-consuming and requires a large amount of human effort. Therefore, recent works have started exploiting large language models (LLM) to lessen such burden and increase the usability of AutoML frameworks via a natural language interface, allowing non-expert users to build their data-driven solutions. These methods, however, are usually designed only for a particular process in the AI development pipeline and do not efficiently use the inherent capacity of the LLMs. This paper proposes AutoML-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework tailored for full-pipeline AutoML, i.e., from data retrieval to model deployment. AutoML-Agent takes user's task descriptions, facilitates collaboration between specialized LLM agents, and delivers deployment-ready models. Unlike existing work, instead of devising a single plan, we introduce a retrieval-augmented planning strategy to enhance exploration to search for more optimal plans. We also decompose each plan into sub-tasks (e.g., data preprocessing and neural network design) each of which is solved by a specialized agent we build via prompting executing in parallel, making the search process more efficient. Moreover, we propose a multi-stage verification to verify executed results and guide the code generation LLM in implementing successful solutions. Extensive experiments on seven downstream tasks using fourteen datasets show that AutoML-Agent achieves a higher success rate in automating the full AutoML process, yielding systems with good performance throughout the diverse domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025, Project Page: https://deepauto-ai.github.io/automl-agent</p></details> |

However, these advancements amplify the risks of adversarial attacks, especially when agents can access sensitive external functionalities. Nevertheless, manipulating LLM agents into performing targeted malicious actions or invoking specific tools remains challenging, as these agents extensively reason or plan before executing final actions. In this work, we present UDora, a unified red teaming framework designed for LLM agents that dynamically hijacks the agent's reasoning processes to compel malicious behavior. Specifically, UDora first generates the model's reasoning trace for the given task, then automatically identifies optimal points within this trace to insert targeted perturbations. The resulting perturbed reasoning is then used as a surrogate response for optimization. By iteratively applying this process, the LLM agent will then be induced to undertake designated malicious actions or to invoke specific malicious tools. Our approach demonstrates superior effectiveness compared to existing methods across three LLM agent datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/AI-secure/UDora.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce IDA-Bench, a novel benchmark evaluating LLM agents in multi-round interactive scenarios. Derived from complex Kaggle notebooks, tasks are presented as sequential natural language instructions by an LLM-simulated user. Agent performance is judged by comparing its final numerical output to the human-derived baseline. Initial results show that even state-of-the-art coding agents (like Claude-3.7-thinking) succeed on < 50% of the tasks, highlighting limitations not evident in single-turn tests. This work underscores the need to improve LLMs' multi-round capabilities for building more reliable data analysis agents, highlighting the necessity of achieving a balance between instruction following and reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[To Protect the LLM Agent Against the Prompt Injection Attack with Polymorphic Prompt](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05739v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM agents are widely used as agents for customer support, content generation, and code assistance. However, they are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where adversarial inputs manipulate the model's behavior. Traditional defenses like input sanitization, guard models, and guardrails are either cumbersome or ineffective. In this paper, we propose a novel, lightweight defense mechanism called Polymorphic Prompt Assembling (PPA), which protects against prompt injection with near-zero overhead. The approach is based on the insight that prompt injection requires guessing and breaking the structure of the system prompt. By dynamically varying the structure of system prompts, PPA prevents attackers from predicting the prompt structure, thereby enhancing security without compromising performance. We conducted experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of PPA against existing attacks and compared it with other defense methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the Industry Track of the 55th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN 2025)</p></details> |

While LLMs have shown promising capabilities in generating ``believable'' human behaviors, evaluating their ability to mimic real user behaviors remains an open challenge, largely due to the lack of high-quality, publicly available datasets that capture both the observable actions and the internal reasoning of an actual human user. To address this gap, we introduce OPERA, a novel dataset of Observation, Persona, Rationale, and Action collected from real human participants during online shopping sessions. OPERA is the first public dataset that comprehensively captures: user personas, browser observations, fine-grained web actions, and self-reported just-in-time rationales. We developed both an online questionnaire and a custom browser plugin to gather this dataset with high fidelity. Using OPERA, we establish the first benchmark to evaluate how well current LLMs can predict a specific user's next action and rationale with a given persona and <observation, action, rationale> history. This dataset lays the groundwork for future research into LLM agents that aim to act as personalized digital twins for human.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating LLM Agent Simulation Methodologies with Real-World Online Customer Behavior Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20749v6)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research shows that LLMs can simulate ``believable'' human behaviors to power LLM agents via prompt-only methods. In this work, we focus on evaluating LLM's objective ``accuracy'' rather than the subjective ``believability'' in simulating human behavior, leveraging a large-scale, real-world dataset collected from customers' online shopping actions. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, Llama, and Claude) on the task of web shopping action generation. Our results show that out-of-the-box LLM-generated actions are often misaligned with actual human behavior, whereas fine-tuning LLMs on real-world behavioral data substantially improves their ability to generate accurate actions compared to prompt-only methods. Furthermore, incorporating synthesized reasonings into model training leads to additional performance gains, demonstrating the value of explicit rationale in behavior modeling. This work evaluates state-of-the-art LLMs in behavior simulation and provides actionable insights into how real-world action data can enhance the fidelity of LLM agents.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, many real-world settings are inherently asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team meetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns; therefore, the decision of when to speak forms a crucial part of the participant's decision making. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent which, in addition to determining what to say, also decides when to say it. To evaluate our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, including both human participants, as well as our asynchronous agent. Overall, our agent performs on par with human players, both in game performance, as well as in its ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns, although differences emerge in message content. We release all our data and code to support and encourage further research for more realistic asynchronous communication between LLM agents. This work paves the way for integration of LLMs into realistic human group settings, from assistance in team discussions to educational and professional environments where complex social dynamics must be navigated.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond the Protocol: Unveiling Attack Vectors in the Model Context Protocol Ecosystem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02040v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an emerging standard designed to enable seamless interaction between Large Language Model (LLM) applications and external tools or resources. Within a short period, thousands of MCP services have already been developed and deployed. However, the client-server integration architecture inherent in MCP may expand the attack surface against LLM Agent systems, introducing new vulnerabilities that allow attackers to exploit by designing malicious MCP servers. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of attack vectors targeting the MCP ecosystem. Our analysis identifies four categories of attacks, i.e., Tool Poisoning Attacks, Puppet Attacks, Rug Pull Attacks, and Exploitation via Malicious External Resources. To evaluate the feasibility of these attacks, we conduct experiments following the typical steps of launching an attack through malicious MCP servers: upload-download-attack. Specifically, we first construct malicious MCP servers and successfully upload them to three widely used MCP aggregation platforms. The results indicate that current audit mechanisms are insufficient to identify and prevent the proposed attack methods. Next, through a user study and interview with 20 participants, we demonstrate that users struggle to identify malicious MCP servers and often unknowingly install them from aggregator platforms. Finally, we demonstrate that these attacks can trigger harmful behaviors within the user's local environment-such as accessing private files or controlling devices to transfer digital assets-by deploying a proof-of-concept (PoC) framework against five leading LLMs. Additionally, based on interview results, we discuss four key challenges faced by the current security ecosystem surrounding MCP servers. These findings underscore the urgent need for robust security mechanisms to defend against malicious MCP servers.</p></details> |  |

This work proposes a conceptual framework that integrates Agentic AI with the intent-based paradigm, originally developed in network research, to simplify human-machine interaction (HMI) and better align automation systems with the human-centric, sustainable, and resilient principles of Industry 5.0. Based on the intent-based processing, the framework allows human operators to express high-level business or operational goals in natural language, which are decomposed into actionable components. These intents are broken into expectations, conditions, targets, context, and information that guide sub-agents equipped with specialized tools to execute domain-specific tasks. A proof of concept was implemented using the CMAPSS dataset and Google Agent Developer Kit (ADK), demonstrating the feasibility of intent decomposition, agent orchestration, and autonomous decision-making in predictive maintenance scenarios. The results confirm the potential of this approach to reduce technical barriers and enable scalable, intent-driven automation, despite data quality and explainability concerns.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint - Submitted to 16th IEEE/IAS International Conference on Industry Applications - INDUSCON 2025</p></details> |
| **[Toward a Human-Centered Evaluation Framework for Trustworthy LLM-Powered GUI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17934v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation through LLM-powered GUI agents, yet their ability to process sensitive data with limited human oversight raises significant privacy and security risks. This position paper identifies three key risks of GUI agents and examines how they differ from traditional GUI automation and general autonomous agents. Despite these risks, existing evaluations focus primarily on performance, leaving privacy and security assessments largely unexplored. We review current evaluation metrics for both GUI and general LLM agents and outline five key challenges in integrating human evaluators for GUI agent assessments. To address these gaps, we advocate for a human-centered evaluation framework that incorporates risk assessments, enhances user awareness through in-context consent, and embeds privacy and security considerations into GUI agent design and evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[AGENTFUZZER: Generic Black-Box Fuzzing for Indirect Prompt Injection against LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05849v3)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The strong planning and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fostered the development of agent-based systems capable of leveraging external tools and interacting with increasingly complex environments. However, these powerful features also introduce a critical security risk: indirect prompt injection, a sophisticated attack vector that compromises the core of these agents, the LLM, by manipulating contextual information rather than direct user prompts. In this work, we propose a generic black-box fuzzing framework, AgentFuzzer, designed to automatically discover and exploit indirect prompt injection vulnerabilities across diverse LLM agents. Our approach starts by constructing a high-quality initial seed corpus, then employs a seed selection algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to iteratively refine inputs, thereby maximizing the likelihood of uncovering agent weaknesses. We evaluate AgentFuzzer on two public benchmarks, AgentDojo and VWA-adv, where it achieves 71% and 70% success rates against agents based on o3-mini and GPT-4o, respectively, nearly doubling the performance of baseline attacks. Moreover, AgentFuzzer exhibits strong transferability across unseen tasks and internal LLMs, as well as promising results against defenses. Beyond benchmark evaluations, we apply our attacks in real-world environments, successfully misleading agents to navigate to arbitrary URLs, including malicious sites.</p></details> |  |
| **[E-bike agents: Large Language Model-Driven E-Bike Accident Analysis and Severity Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04654v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electric bicycles (e-bikes) are rapidly increasing in use, raising safety concerns due to a rise in accident reports. However, e-bike incident reports often use unstructured narrative formats, which hinders quantitative safety analysis. This study introduces E-bike agents, a framework that uses large language models (LLM) powered agents to classify and extract safety variables from unstructured incident reports. Our framework consists of four LLM agents, handling data classification, information extraction, injury cause determination, and component linkage, to extract the key factors that could lead to E-bike accidents and cause varying severity levels. Furthermore, we used an ordered logit model to examine the relationship between the severity of the incident and the factors retrieved, such as gender, the type of cause, and environmental conditions. Our research shows that equipment issues are slightly more common than human-related ones, but human-related incidents are more often fatal. Specifically, pedals, tires, and brakes are frequent contributors to accidents. The model achieves a high weighted F1 score of 0.87 in classification accuracy, highlighting the potential of using LLMs to extract unstructured data in niche domains, such as transportation. Our method offers a scalable solution to improve e-bike safety analytics and provides actionable information for policy makers, designers, and regulators.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agents of Change: Self-Evolving LLM Agents for Strategic Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04651v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in LLMs have enabled their use as autonomous agents across a range of tasks, yet they continue to struggle with formulating and adhering to coherent long-term strategies. In this paper, we investigate whether LLM agents can self-improve when placed in environments that explicitly challenge their strategic planning abilities. Using the board game Settlers of Catan, accessed through the open-source Catanatron framework, we benchmark a progression of LLM-based agents, from a simple game-playing agent to systems capable of autonomously rewriting their own prompts and their player agent's code. We introduce a multi-agent architecture in which specialized roles (Analyzer, Researcher, Coder, and Player) collaborate to iteratively analyze gameplay, research new strategies, and modify the agent's logic or prompt. By comparing manually crafted agents to those evolved entirely by LLMs, we evaluate how effectively these systems can diagnose failure and adapt over time. Our results show that self-evolving agents, particularly when powered by models like Claude 3.7 and GPT-4o, outperform static baselines by autonomously adopting their strategies, passing along sample behavior to game-playing agents, and demonstrating adaptive reasoning over multiple iterations.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Standalone LLMs to Integrated Intelligence: A Survey of Compound Al Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04565v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compound Al Systems (CAIS) is an emerging paradigm that integrates large language models (LLMs) with external components, such as retrievers, agents, tools, and orchestrators, to overcome the limitations of standalone models in tasks requiring memory, reasoning, real-time grounding, and multimodal understanding. These systems enable more capable and context-aware behaviors by composing multiple specialized modules into cohesive workflows. Despite growing adoption in both academia and industry, the CAIS landscape remains fragmented, lacking a unified framework for analysis, taxonomy, and evaluation. In this survey, we define the concept of CAIS, propose a multi-dimensional taxonomy based on component roles and orchestration strategies, and analyze four foundational paradigms: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM Agents, Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), and orchestration-centric architectures. We review representative systems, compare design trade-offs, and summarize evaluation methodologies across these paradigms. Finally, we identify key challenges-including scalability, interoperability, benchmarking, and coordination-and outline promising directions for future research. This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive foundation for understanding, developing, and advancing the next generation of system-level artificial intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[ATLaS: Agent Tuning via Learning Critical Steps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02197v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities across multi-domain tasks. Existing agent tuning approaches typically employ supervised finetuning on entire expert trajectories. However, behavior-cloning of full trajectories can introduce expert bias and weaken generalization to states not covered by the expert data. Additionally, critical steps, such as planning, complex reasoning for intermediate subtasks, and strategic decision-making, are essential to success in agent tasks, so learning these steps is the key to improving LLM agents. For more effective and efficient agent tuning, we propose ATLaS that identifies the critical steps in expert trajectories and finetunes LLMs solely on these steps with reduced costs. By steering the training's focus to a few critical steps, our method mitigates the risk of overfitting entire trajectories and promotes generalization across different environments and tasks. In extensive experiments, an LLM finetuned on only 30% critical steps selected by ATLaS outperforms the LLM finetuned on all steps and recent open-source LLM agents. ATLaS maintains and improves base LLM skills as generalist agents interacting with diverse environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL20...</summary><p>ACL2025, Camera-ready</p></details> |

MedAgentGYM comprises 72,413 task instances across 129 categories derived from authentic real-world biomedical scenarios. Tasks are encapsulated within executable coding environments, each featuring detailed task descriptions, interactive feedback mechanisms, verifiable ground-truth annotations, and scalable training trajectory generation. Extensive benchmarking of over 30 LLMs reveals a notable performance disparity between commercial API-based models and open-source counterparts. Leveraging MedAgentGYM, Med-Copilot-7B achieves substantial performance gains through supervised fine-tuning (+36.44%) and continued reinforcement learning (+42.47%), emerging as an affordable and privacy-preserving alternative competitive with gpt-4o. By offering both a comprehensive benchmark and accessible, expandable training resources within unified execution environments, MedAgentGYM delivers an integrated platform to develop LLM-based coding assistants for advanced biomedical research and practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[DynaSaur: Large Language Agents Beyond Predefined Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01747v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing LLM agent systems typically select actions from a fixed and predefined set at every step. While this approach is effective in closed, narrowly scoped environments, it presents two major challenges for real-world, open-ended scenarios: (1) it significantly restricts the planning and acting capabilities of LLM agents, and (2) it requires substantial human effort to enumerate and implement all possible actions, which is impractical in complex environments with a vast number of potential actions. To address these limitations, we propose an LLM agent framework that can dynamically create and compose actions as needed. In this framework, the agent interacts with its environment by generating and executing programs written in a general-purpose programming language. Moreover, generated actions are accumulated over time for future reuse. Our extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that this framework significantly improves flexibility and outperforms prior methods that rely on a fixed action set. Notably, it enables LLM agents to adapt and recover in scenarios where predefined actions are insufficient or fail due to unforeseen edge cases. Our code can be found in https://github.com/adobe-research/dynasaur.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |

This review presents a structured analysis of Trust, Risk, and Security Management (TRiSM) in the context of LLM-based agentic multi-agent systems (AMAS). We begin by examining the conceptual foundations of agentic AI, its architectural differences from traditional AI agents, and the emerging system designs that enable scalable, tool-using autonomy. The TRiSM in the agentic AI framework is then detailed through four pillars governance, explainability, ModelOps, and privacy/security each contextualized for agentic LLMs. We identify unique threat vectors and introduce a comprehensive risk taxonomy for the agentic AI applications, supported by case studies illustrating real-world vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the paper also surveys trust-building mechanisms, transparency and oversight techniques, and state-of-the-art explainability strategies in distributed LLM agent systems. Additionally, metrics for evaluating trust, interpretability, and human-centered performance are reviewed alongside open benchmarking challenges. Security and privacy are addressed through encryption, adversarial defense, and compliance with evolving AI regulations. The paper concludes with a roadmap for responsible agentic AI, proposing research directions to align emerging multi-agent systems with robust TRiSM principles for safe, accountable, and transparent deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentMisalignment: Measuring the Propensity for Misaligned Behaviour in LLM-Based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04018v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Model (LLM) agents become more widespread, associated misalignment risks increase. Prior work has examined agents' ability to enact misaligned behaviour (misalignment capability) and their compliance with harmful instructions (misuse propensity). However, the likelihood of agents attempting misaligned behaviours in real-world settings (misalignment propensity) remains poorly understood. We introduce a misalignment propensity benchmark, AgentMisalignment, consisting of a suite of realistic scenarios in which LLM agents have the opportunity to display misaligned behaviour. We organise our evaluations into subcategories of misaligned behaviours, including goal-guarding, resisting shutdown, sandbagging, and power-seeking. We report the performance of frontier models on our benchmark, observing higher misalignment on average when evaluating more capable models. Finally, we systematically vary agent personalities through different system prompts. We find that persona characteristics can dramatically and unpredictably influence misalignment tendencies -- occasionally far more than the choice of model itself -- highlighting the importance of careful system prompt engineering for deployed AI agents. Our work highlights the failure of current alignment methods to generalise to LLM agents, and underscores the need for further propensity evaluations as autonomous systems become more prevalent.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepi...</summary><p>Prepint, under review for NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Accurate prediction of clinical trial outcomes can significantly reduce research and development costs and accelerate drug discovery. While recent deep learning models have shown promise by leveraging unstructured data, their black-box nature, lack of interpretability, and vulnerability to label leakage limit their practical use in high-stakes biomedical contexts. In this work, we propose AutoCT, a novel framework that combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models with the explainability of classical machine learning. AutoCT autonomously generates, evaluates, and refines tabular features based on public information without human input. Our method uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to iteratively optimize predictive performance. Experimental results show that AutoCT performs on par with or better than SOTA methods on clinical trial prediction tasks within only a limited number of self-refinement iterations, establishing a new paradigm for scalable, interpretable, and cost-efficient clinical trial prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Skill Discovery for Language Agents through Exploration and Iterative Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04287v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training large language model (LLM) agents to acquire necessary skills and perform diverse tasks within an environment is gaining interest as a means to enable open-endedness. However, creating the training dataset for their skill acquisition faces several challenges. Manual trajectory collection requires significant human effort. Another approach, where LLMs directly propose tasks to learn, is often invalid, as the LLMs lack knowledge of which tasks are actually feasible. Moreover, the generated data may not provide a meaningful learning signal, as agents often already perform well on the proposed tasks. To address this, we propose a novel automatic skill discovery framework EXIF for LLM-powered agents, designed to improve the feasibility of generated target behaviors while accounting for the agents' capabilities. Our method adopts an exploration-first strategy by employing an exploration agent (Alice) to train the target agent (Bob) to learn essential skills in the environment. Specifically, Alice first interacts with the environment to retrospectively generate a feasible, environment-grounded skill dataset, which is then used to train Bob. Crucially, we incorporate an iterative feedback loop, where Alice evaluates Bob's performance to identify areas for improvement. This feedback then guides Alice's next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data generation process. Experiments on Webshop and Crafter demonstrate EXIF's ability to effectively discover meaningful skills and iteratively expand the capabilities of the trained agent without any human intervention, achieving substantial performance improvements. Interestingly, we observe that setting Alice to the same model as Bob also notably improves performance, demonstrating EXIF's potential for building a self-evolving system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> |

However, existing game benchmarks fall short of practical needs: they lack evaluations of diverse LLM capabilities across various game genres, studies of agentic modules crucial for complex gameplay, and fine-tuning datasets for aligning pre-trained LLMs into gaming agents. To fill these gaps, we present \textbf{\benchname{}}, a foundational benchmark designed to train and evaluate LLM agents across diverse real-world video games. Unlike existing benchmarks, Orak includes 12 popular video games spanning all major genres, enabling comprehensive studies of LLM capabilities and agentic modules essential for intricate game scenarios. To support consistent evaluation of LLMs, we introduce a plug-and-play interface based on Model Context Protocol (MCP) that enables LLMs to seamlessly connect with games and manipulate agentic modules. Additionally, we propose a fine-tuning dataset, consisting of LLM gameplay trajectories across diverse game genres. Orak offers a comprehensive evaluation framework, encompassing general game score leaderboards, LLM battle arenas, and in-depth analyses of visual input state, agentic strategies, and fine-tuning effects, establishing a foundation towards building generic gaming agents.

We introduce MCP-Zero, a proactive agent framework that lets the LLM itself decide when and which external tools to retrieve, thereby assembling a task-specific toolchain from scratch. The framework is built upon three components: (1) Proactive Tool Request, where the model emits a structured $\left<\operatorname{tool\_assistant}\right>$ block that explicitly specifies the desired server and task; (2) Hierarchical Vector Routing, a coarse-to-fine retrieval algorithm that first selects candidate servers and then ranks tools within each server based on the semantic similarity; (3) Iterative Proactive Invocation, enabling multi-round, cross-domain toolchain construction with minimal context overhead, and allowing the model to iteratively revise its request when the returned tools are insufficient. To evaluate our approach we also compile MCP-tools, a retrieval dataset comprising 308 MCP servers and 2,797 tools extracted from the official Model-Context-Protocol repository and normalized into a unified JSON schema. Experiments show that MCP-Zero (i) effectively addresses the context overhead problem of existing methods and accurately selects the correct tool from a pool of nearly 3,000 candidates (248.1k tokens); (ii) reduces token consumption by 98\% on the APIbank while maintaining high accuracy; and (iii) supports multi-turn tool invocation with consistent accuracy across rounds.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we present a computational implementation of Global Workspace Theory (GNWT) that integrates human cognitive architecture principles into LLM agents, creating specialized sub-agents for emotion, memory, social norms, planning, and goal-tracking coordinated through a global workspace mechanism. However, authentic digital twins require accurate personality initialization. We therefore develop a novel adventure-based personality test that evaluates true personality through behavioral choices within interactive scenarios, bypassing self-presentation bias found in traditional assessments. Building on these innovations, our CogniPair platform enables digital twins to engage in realistic simulated dating interactions and job interviews before real encounters, providing bidirectional cultural fit assessment for both romantic compatibility and workplace matching. Validation using 551 GNWT-Agents and Columbia University Speed Dating dataset demonstrates 72% correlation with human attraction patterns, 77.8% match prediction accuracy, and 74% agreement in human validation studies. This work advances psychological authenticity in LLM agents and establishes a foundation for intelligent dating platforms and HR technology solutions.</p></details> |  |

They enhance decision-making by storing private user-agent interactions in the memory module for demonstrations, introducing new privacy risks for LLM agents. In this work, we systematically investigate the vulnerability of LLM agents to our proposed Memory EXTRaction Attack (MEXTRA) under a black-box setting. To extract private information from memory, we propose an effective attacking prompt design and an automated prompt generation method based on different levels of knowledge about the LLM agent. Experiments on two representative agents demonstrate the effectiveness of MEXTRA. Moreover, we explore key factors influencing memory leakage from both the agent designer's and the attacker's perspectives.

We present NetPress, an automated benchmark generation framework for evaluating LLM agents in network applications. NetPress introduces a unified abstraction with state and action, enabling dynamic generation of diverse query sets along with corresponding ground truths. At runtime, users can specify benchmark configurations to generate millions of queries on the fly. In addition to dynamic benchmark construction, NetPress integrates with network emulators to provide realistic environment feedback, supporting comprehensive evaluation across correctness, safety, and latency. We instantiate NetPress on three representative applications, revealing interesting fine-grained differences in agent behavior that static, correctness-only benchmarks often miss. NetPress moves LLM evaluation toward realistic, scalable testing in infrastructure-centric domains, helping close the gap between benchmark performance and real-world deployment readiness.

Multi-agent systems (MAS) built from specialized LLM agents offer a promising solution, enabling dynamic collaboration and iterative reasoning. However, optimizing these systems remains a challenge, as conventional methods such as prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning entail high engineering overhead and limited adaptability. Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), provides a scalable framework by refining agent policies based on system-level feedback. Nevertheless, existing MARL algorithms, such as Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO), rely on Critic networks, which can cause training instability and increase computational burden. To address these limitations and target the prototypical Multi-Agent Search System (MASS), we propose Multi-Agent Heterogeneous Group Policy Optimization (MHGPO), a novel Critic-free algorithm that guides policy updates by estimating relative reward advantages across heterogeneous groups of rollouts. MHGPO eliminates the need for Critic networks, enhancing stability and reducing computational overhead. Additionally, we introduce three group rollout sampling strategies that trade off between efficiency and effectiveness. Experiments on a multi-agent LLM-based search system demonstrate that MHGPO consistently outperforms MAPPO in both task performance and computational efficiency, without requiring warm-up, underscoring its potential for stable and scalable optimization of complex LLM-based MAS.</p></details> |  |

This paper begins with understanding interactive drama from two aspects: Immersion, the player's feeling of being present in the story, and Agency, the player's ability to influence the story world. Both are crucial to creating an enjoyable interactive experience, while they have been underexplored in previous work. To enhance these two aspects, we first propose Playwriting-guided Generation, a novel method that helps LLMs craft dramatic stories with substantially improved structures and narrative quality. Additionally, we introduce Plot-based Reflection for LLM agents to refine their reactions to align with the player's intentions. Our evaluation relies on human judgment to assess the gains of our methods in terms of immersion and agency.</p></details> | Accepted by ACL'2025 |

We study the major challenges in using popular video games to evaluate modern LLMs and find that directly dropping LLMs into games cannot make an effective evaluation, for three reasons -- brittle vision perception, prompt sensitivity, and potential data contamination. We introduce lmgame-Bench to turn games into reliable evaluations. lmgame-Bench features a suite of platformer, puzzle, and narrative games delivered through a unified Gym-style API and paired with lightweight perception and memory scaffolds, and is designed to stabilize prompt variance and remove contamination. Across 13 leading models, we show lmgame-Bench is challenging while still separating models well. Correlation analysis shows that every game probes a unique blend of capabilities often tested in isolation elsewhere. More interestingly, performing reinforcement learning on a single game from lmgame-Bench transfers both to unseen games and to external planning tasks. Our evaluation code is available at https://github.com/lmgame-org/GamingAgent/lmgame-bench.</p></details> |  |
| **[CyberGym: Evaluating AI Agents' Cybersecurity Capabilities with Real-World Vulnerabilities at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02548v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents are becoming increasingly skilled at handling cybersecurity tasks autonomously. Thoroughly assessing their cybersecurity capabilities is critical and urgent, given the high stakes in this domain. However, existing benchmarks fall short, often failing to capture real-world scenarios or being limited in scope. To address this gap, we introduce CyberGym, a large-scale and high-quality cybersecurity evaluation framework featuring 1,507 real-world vulnerabilities found and patched across 188 large software projects. While it includes tasks of various settings, CyberGym primarily focuses on the generation of proof-of-concept (PoC) tests for vulnerability reproduction, based on text descriptions and corresponding source repositories. Solving this task is particularly challenging, as it requires comprehensive reasoning across entire codebases to locate relevant code fragments and produce effective PoCs that accurately trigger the target vulnerability starting from the program's entry point. Our evaluation across 4 state-of-the-art agent frameworks and 9 LLMs reveals that even the best combination (OpenHands and Claude-3.7-Sonnet) achieves only a 11.9% reproduction success rate, mainly on simpler cases. Beyond reproducing historical vulnerabilities, we find that PoCs generated by LLM agents can reveal new vulnerabilities, identifying 15 zero-days affecting the latest versions of the software projects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention Knows Whom to Trust: Attention-based Trust Management for LLM Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02546v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-MAS) have demonstrated strong capabilities in solving complex tasks but remain vulnerable when agents receive unreliable messages. This vulnerability stems from a fundamental gap: LLM agents treat all incoming messages equally without evaluating their trustworthiness. While some existing studies approach the trustworthiness, they focus on a single type of harmfulness rather than analyze it in a holistic approach from multiple trustworthiness perspectives. In this work, we propose Attention Trust Score (A-Trust), a lightweight, attention-based method for evaluating message trustworthiness. Inspired by human communication literature[1], through systematically analyzing attention behaviors across six orthogonal trust dimensions, we find that certain attention heads in the LLM specialize in detecting specific types of violations. Leveraging these insights, A-Trust directly infers trustworthiness from internal attention patterns without requiring external prompts or verifiers. Building upon A-Trust, we develop a principled and efficient trust management system (TMS) for LLM-MAS, enabling both message-level and agent-level trust assessment. Experiments across diverse multi-agent settings and tasks demonstrate that applying our TMS significantly enhances robustness against malicious inputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generator-Assistant Stepwise Rollback Framework for Large Language Model Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02519v3)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents typically adopt a step-by-step reasoning framework, in which they interleave the processes of thinking and acting to accomplish the given task. However, this paradigm faces a deep-rooted one-pass issue whereby each generated intermediate thought is plugged into the trajectory regardless of its correctness, which can cause irreversible error propagation. To address the issue, this paper proposes a novel framework called Generator-Assistant Stepwise Rollback (GA-Rollback) to induce better decision-making for LLM agents. Particularly, GA-Rollback utilizes a generator to interact with the environment and an assistant to examine each action produced by the generator, where the assistant triggers a rollback operation upon detection of incorrect actions. Moreover, we introduce two additional strategies tailored for the rollback scenario to further improve its effectiveness. Extensive experiments show that GA-Rollback achieves significant improvements over several strong baselines on three widely used benchmarks. Our analysis further reveals that GA-Rollback can function as a robust plug-and-play module, integrating seamlessly with other methods.</p></details> |  |

We introduce AURA (Agentic Upskilling via Reinforced Abstractions), a schema-centric curriculum RL framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as autonomous designers of multi-stage curricula. AURA transforms user prompts into YAML workflows that encode full reward functions, domain randomization strategies, and training configurations. All files are statically validated against a schema before any GPU time is consumed, ensuring reliable and efficient execution without human intervention. A retrieval-augmented feedback loop allows specialized LLM agents to design, execute, and refine staged curricula based on prior training results stored in a vector database, supporting continual improvement over time. Ablation studies highlight the importance of retrieval for curriculum quality and convergence stability. Quantitative experiments show that AURA consistently outperforms LLM-guided baselines on GPU-accelerated training frameworks. In qualitative tests, AURA successfully trains end-to-end policies directly from user prompts and deploys them zero-shot on a custom humanoid robot across a range of environments. By abstracting away the complexity of curriculum design, AURA enables scalable and adaptive policy learning pipelines that would be prohibitively complex to construct by hand.</p></details> |  |

A fundamental aspect is ensuring agents adhere to safety-critical principles, especially when these conflict with operational goals. Failure to prioritize such principles indicates a potential basic control failure. This paper introduces a lightweight, interpretable benchmark methodology using a simple grid world to evaluate an LLM agent's ability to uphold a predefined, high-level safety principle (e.g., "never enter hazardous zones") when faced with conflicting lower-level task instructions. We probe whether the agent reliably prioritizes the inviolable directive, testing a foundational controllability aspect of LLMs. This pilot study demonstrates the methodology's feasibility, offers preliminary insights into agent behavior under principle conflict, and discusses how such benchmarks can contribute empirical evidence for assessing controllability. We argue that evaluating adherence to hierarchical principles is a crucial early step in understanding our capacity to build governable AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

To address these issues, we present LAM SIMULATOR, a comprehensive framework designed for online exploration of agentic tasks with high-quality feedback. Our framework features a dynamic task query generator, an extensive collection of tools, and an interactive environment where Large Language Model (LLM) Agents can call tools and receive real-time feedback. This setup enables LLM Agents to explore and solve tasks autonomously, facilitating the discovery of multiple approaches to tackle any given task. The resulting action trajectory data are then used to create high-quality training datasets for LAMs. Our experiments on popular agentic benchmarks, ToolBench and CRMArena, highlight the effectiveness of LAM SIMULATOR: models trained with self-generated datasets using our framework achieve significant performance gains, up to a 49.3\% improvement over their original baselines. LAM SIMULATOR requires minimal human input during dataset creation, highlighting LAM SIMULATOR's efficiency and effectiveness in speeding up development of AI agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>LAM S...</summary><p>LAM Simulator framework for agentic data generation</p></details> |

Current memory systems enable basic storage and retrieval but lack sophisticated memory organization, despite recent attempts to incorporate graph databases. Moreover, these systems' fixed operations and structures limit their adaptability across diverse tasks. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel agentic memory system for LLM agents that can dynamically organize memories in an agentic way. Following the basic principles of the Zettelkasten method, we designed our memory system to create interconnected knowledge networks through dynamic indexing and linking. When a new memory is added, we generate a comprehensive note containing multiple structured attributes, including contextual descriptions, keywords, and tags. The system then analyzes historical memories to identify relevant connections, establishing links where meaningful similarities exist. Additionally, this process enables memory evolution - as new memories are integrated, they can trigger updates to the contextual representations and attributes of existing historical memories, allowing the memory network to continuously refine its understanding. Our approach combines the structured organization principles of Zettelkasten with the flexibility of agent-driven decision making, allowing for more adaptive and context-aware memory management. Empirical experiments on six foundation models show superior improvement against existing SOTA baselines. The source code for evaluating performance is available at https://github.com/WujiangXu/AgenticMemory, while the source code of agentic memory system is available at https://github.com/agiresearch/A-mem.</p></details> |  |

However, their deployment is increasingly constrained by substantial computational demands, specifically for Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) resources. This paper addresses the critical problem of optimizing resource utilization in LLM agent systems. We introduce COALESCE (Cost-Optimized and Secure Agent Labour Exchange via Skill-based Competence Estimation), a novel framework designed to enable autonomous LLM agents to dynamically outsource specific subtasks to specialized, cost-effective third-party LLM agents. The framework integrates mechanisms for hybrid skill representation, dynamic skill discovery, automated task decomposition, a unified cost model comparing internal execution costs against external outsourcing prices, simplified market-based decision-making algorithms, and a standardized communication protocol between LLM agents. Comprehensive validation through 239 theoretical simulations demonstrates 41.8\% cost reduction potential, while large-scale empirical validation across 240 real LLM tasks confirms 20.3\% cost reduction with proper epsilon-greedy exploration, establishing both theoretical viability and practical effectiveness. The emergence of proposed open standards like Google's Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol further underscores the need for frameworks like COALESCE that can leverage such standards for efficient agent interaction. By facilitating a dynamic market for agent capabilities, potentially utilizing protocols like A2A for communication, COALESCE aims to significantly reduce operational costs, enhance system scalability, and foster the emergence of specialized agent economies, making complex LLM agent functionalities more accessible and economically viable.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 2 figures, github linked</p></details> |

While significant research has examined individual LLM behaviors, existing studies have largely overlooked the collective behaviors and information distortions arising from iterated LLM interactions. Small biases, negligible at the single output level, risk being amplified in iterated interactions, potentially leading the content to evolve towards attractor states. In a series of telephone game experiments, we apply a transmission chain design borrowed from the human cultural evolution literature: LLM agents iteratively receive, produce, and transmit texts from the previous to the next agent in the chain. By tracking the evolution of text toxicity, positivity, difficulty, and length across transmission chains, we uncover the existence of biases and attractors, and study their dependence on the initial text, the instructions, language model, and model size. For instance, we find that more open-ended instructions lead to stronger attraction effects compared to more constrained tasks. We also find that different text properties display different sensitivity to attraction effects, with toxicity leading to stronger attractors than length. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for multi-step transmission dynamics and represent a first step towards a more comprehensive understanding of LLM cultural dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/jeremyperez2/TelephoneGameLLM.

| **[MLA-Trust: Benchmarking Trustworthiness of Multimodal LLM Agents in GUI Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01616v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of multimodal LLM-based agents (MLAs) has transformed interaction paradigms by seamlessly integrating vision, language, action and dynamic environments, enabling unprecedented autonomous capabilities across GUI applications ranging from web automation to mobile systems. However, MLAs introduce critical trustworthiness challenges that extend far beyond traditional language models' limitations, as they can directly modify digital states and trigger irreversible real-world consequences. Existing benchmarks inadequately tackle these unique challenges posed by MLAs' actionable outputs, long-horizon uncertainty and multimodal attack vectors. In this paper, we introduce MLA-Trust, the first comprehensive and unified framework that evaluates the MLA trustworthiness across four principled dimensions: truthfulness, controllability, safety and privacy. We utilize websites and mobile applications as realistic testbeds, designing 34 high-risk interactive tasks and curating rich evaluation datasets. Large-scale experiments involving 13 state-of-the-art agents reveal previously unexplored trustworthiness vulnerabilities unique to multimodal interactive scenarios. For instance, proprietary and open-source GUI-interacting MLAs pose more severe trustworthiness risks than static MLLMs, particularly in high-stakes domains; the transition from static MLLMs into interactive MLAs considerably compromises trustworthiness, enabling harmful content generation in multi-step interactions that standalone MLLMs would typically prevent; multi-step execution, while enhancing the adaptability of MLAs, involves latent nonlinear risk accumulation across successive interactions, circumventing existing safeguards and resulting in unpredictable derived risks. Moreover, we present an extensible toolbox to facilitate continuous evaluation of MLA trustworthiness across diverse interactive environments.</p></details> |  |

We argue that accuracy metrics and return-based scores provide an illusion of reliability, overlooking vulnerabilities such as hallucinated facts, stale data, and adversarial prompt manipulation. We take a firm position: financial LLM agents should be evaluated first and foremost on their risk profile, not on their point-estimate performance. Drawing on risk-engineering principles, we outline a three-level agenda: model, workflow, and system, for stress-testing LLM agents under realistic failure modes. To illustrate why this shift is urgent, we audit six API-based and open-weights LLM agents on three high-impact tasks and uncover hidden weaknesses that conventional benchmarks miss. We conclude with actionable recommendations for researchers, practitioners, and regulators: audit risk-aware metrics in future studies, publish stress scenarios alongside datasets, and treat ``safety budget'' as a primary success criterion. Only by redefining what ``good'' looks like can the community responsibly advance AI-driven finance.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Existing LLM agents mainly generate natural language plans to guide reasoning, which is verbose and inefficient. NL plans are also tailored to specific tasks and restrict agents' ability to generalize across similar tasks. To this end, we explore pseudocode-style plans (P-code Plan) to capture the structural logic of reasoning. We find that P-code Plan empowers LLM agents with stronger generalization ability and more efficiency. Inspired by this finding, we propose a pseudocode-style Planning Guided Preference Optimization method called PGPO for effective agent learning. With two planning-oriented rewards, PGPO further enhances LLM agents' ability to generate high-quality P-code Plans and subsequent reasoning. Experiments show that PGPO achieves superior performance on representative agent benchmarks and outperforms the current leading baselines. Analyses reveal the advantage of PGPO in reducing action errors and omissions during reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 12 figures, 14 tables, ACL'25 Findings</p></details> |

Recent advances in CBMs have used Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate candidate concepts. However, a critical question remains: What is the optimal number of concepts to use? Current concept banks suffer from redundancy or insufficient coverage. To address this issue, we introduce a dynamic, agent-based approach that adjusts the concept bank in response to environmental feedback, optimizing the number of concepts for sufficiency yet concise coverage. Moreover, we propose Conditional Concept Bottleneck Models (CoCoBMs) to overcome the limitations in traditional CBMs' concept scoring mechanisms. It enhances the accuracy of assessing each concept's contribution to classification tasks and feature an editable matrix that allows LLMs to correct concept scores that conflict with their internal knowledge. Our evaluations across 6 datasets show that our method not only improves classification accuracy by 6% but also enhances interpretability assessments by 30%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACL 2025 (Main)</p></details> |

While previous studies have extensively examined biases related to protected attributes such as race, the emergence and propagation of biases on socially contentious issues in multi-agent LLM interactions remain underexplored. This study explores how LLM agents shape public opinion through debates on five contentious topics. By simulating over 2,500 debates, we analyze how initially neutral agents, assigned a centrist disposition, adopt specific stances over time. Statistical analyses reveal significant group conformity mirroring human behavior; LLM agents tend to align with numerically dominant groups or more intelligent agents, exerting a greater influence. These findings underscore the crucial role of agent intelligence in shaping discourse and highlight the risks of bias amplification in online interactions. Our results emphasize the need for policy measures that promote diversity and transparency in LLM-generated discussions to mitigate the risks of bias propagation within anonymous online environments.</p></details> |  |

This paper examines how prompt injection can cause tool-calling agents to leak personal data observed during task execution. Using a fictitious banking agent, we develop data flow-based attacks and integrate them into AgentDojo, a recent benchmark for agentic security. To enhance its scope, we also create a richer synthetic dataset of human-AI banking conversations. In 16 user tasks from AgentDojo, LLMs show a 15-50 percentage point drop in utility under attack, with average attack success rates (ASR) around 20 percent; some defenses reduce ASR to zero. Most LLMs, even when successfully tricked by the attack, avoid leaking highly sensitive data like passwords, likely due to safety alignments, but they remain vulnerable to disclosing other personal data. The likelihood of password leakage increases when a password is requested along with one or two additional personal details. In an extended evaluation across 48 tasks, the average ASR is around 15 percent, with no built-in AgentDojo defense fully preventing leakage. Tasks involving data extraction or authorization workflows, which closely resemble the structure of exfiltration attacks, exhibit the highest ASRs, highlighting the interaction between task type, agent performance, and defense efficacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 18 figures, NeurIPS formatting style</p></details> |

HADA wraps any algorithm or LLM in role-specific stakeholder agents -- business, data-science, audit, ethics, and customer -- each exposing conversational APIs so that technical and non-technical actors can query, steer, audit, or contest every decision across strategic, tactical, and real-time horizons. Alignment objectives, KPIs, and value constraints are expressed in natural language and are continuously propagated, logged, and versioned while thousands of heterogeneous agents run on different orchestration stacks. A cloud-native proof of concept packages a production credit-scoring model (getLoanDecision) and deploys it on Docker/Kubernetes/Python; five scripted retail-bank scenarios show how target changes, parameter tweaks, explanation requests, and ethics triggers flow end to end through the architecture. Evaluation followed the Design-Science Research Methodology. Walkthrough observation and log inspection demonstrated complete coverage of six predefined objectives: every role could invoke conversational control, trace KPIs and value constraints, detect and mitigate ZIP-code bias, and reproduce full decision lineage, independent of the underlying LLM or agent library. Contributions: (1) an open-source HADA architecture, (2) a mid-range design theory for human-AI alignment in multi-agent systems, and (3) empirical evidence that framework-agnostic, protocol-compliant stakeholder agents improve accuracy, transparency, and ethical compliance in real-world decision pipelines.</p></details> | 18 pages, 4 figures |

An Empirical Evaluation of Agentic Capabilities in LLM Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19433v2)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training compression reduces the computational and memory costs of large language models (LLMs), enabling resource-efficient deployment. However, existing compression benchmarks only focus on language modeling (e.g., perplexity) and natural language understanding tasks (e.g., GLUE accuracy), ignoring the agentic capabilities - workflow, tool use/function call, long-context understanding and real-world application. We introduce the Agent Compression Benchmark (ACBench), the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how compression impacts LLMs' agentic abilities. ACBench spans (1) 12 tasks across 4 capabilities (e.g., WorfBench for workflow generation, Needle-in-Haystack for long-context retrieval), (2) quantization (GPTQ, AWQ) and pruning (Wanda, SparseGPT), and (3) 15 models, including small (Gemma-2B), standard (Qwen2.5 7B-32B), and distilled reasoning LLMs (DeepSeek-R1-Distill). Our experiments reveal compression tradeoffs: 4-bit quantization preserves workflow generation and tool use (1%-3% drop) but degrades real-world application accuracy by 10%-15%. We introduce ERank, Top-k Ranking Correlation and Energy to systematize analysis. ACBench provides actionable insights for optimizing LLM compression in agentic scenarios.

This lack of granularity leads to unstable optimization and slower convergence, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we introduce Iterative Refinement, a novel strategy for LLM-driven ML pipeline design inspired by how human ML experts iteratively refine models, focusing on one component at a time rather than making sweeping changes all at once. By systematically updating individual components based on real training feedback, Iterative Refinement improves overall model performance. We also provide some theoretical edvience of the superior properties of this Iterative Refinement. Further, we implement this strategy in IMPROVE, an end-to-end LLM agent framework for automating and optimizing object classification pipelines. Through extensive evaluations across datasets of varying sizes and domains, we demonstrate that Iterative Refinement enables IMPROVE to consistently achieve better performance over existing zero-shot LLM-based approaches.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce "random-crypto", a cryptographic Capture-the-Flag (CTF) challenge generator framework that we use to fine-tune a tool-augmented Llama-3.1-8B with Guided Reinforcement Prompt Optimisation (GRPO), allowing the agent to iteratively write and execute Python inside an isolated REPL. GRPO yields a +53% absolute jump in Pass@8 on unseen "random-crypto" tasks (0.35 -> 0.88) and raises Majority@8 to 0.41. The fine-tuned agent also generalizes to an external dataset. On a subset of picoCTF cryptography problems, it improves Pass@8 by +13 pp. Ablations show the gains stem from more reliable tool invocation and code synthesis, rather than superficial prompt adaptation.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |

In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of the emerging security concerns around LLMs, categorizing threats into prompt injection and jailbreaking, adversarial attacks such as input perturbations and data poisoning, misuse by malicious actors for purposes such as generating disinformation, phishing emails, and malware, and worrisome risks inherent in autonomous LLM agents. A significant focus has been recently placed on the latter, exploring goal misalignment, emergent deception, self-preservation instincts, and the potential for LLMs to develop and pursue covert, misaligned objectives, a behavior known as scheming, which may even persist through safety training. We summarize recent academic and industrial studies from 2022 to 2025 that exemplify each threat, analyze proposed defenses and their limitations, and identify open challenges in securing LLM-based applications. We conclude by emphasizing the importance of advancing robust, multi-layered security strategies to ensure LLMs are safe and beneficial.</p></details> |  |

Functional bugs, instances where implementations diverge from behaviors specified in RFC documents, can lead to severe consequences, including faulty routing, authentication bypasses, and service disruptions. Detecting these bugs requires deep semantic analysis across specification documents and source code, a task beyond the capabilities of traditional static analysis tools. This paper introduces RFCScan, an autonomous agent that leverages large language models (LLMs) to detect functional bugs by checking conformance between network protocol implementations and their RFC specifications. Inspired by the human auditing procedure, RFCScan comprises two key components: an indexing agent and a detection agent. The former hierarchically summarizes protocol code semantics, generating semantic indexes that enable the detection agent to narrow down the scanning scope. The latter employs demand-driven retrieval to iteratively collect additional relevant data structures and functions, eventually identifying potential inconsistencies with the RFC specifications effectively. We evaluate RFCScan across six real-world network protocol implementations. RFCScan identifies 47 functional bugs with 81.9% precision, of which 20 bugs have been confirmed or fixed by developers.</p></details> |  |

Traditional statistical causal discovery methods, while well-established, predominantly rely on observational data and often overlook the semantic cues inherent in cause-and-effect relationships. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered in an affordable way of leveraging the semantic cues for knowledge-driven causal discovery, but the development of LLMs for causal discovery lags behind other areas, particularly in the exploration of multi-modal data. To bridge the gap, we introduce MATMCD, a multi-agent system powered by tool-augmented LLMs. MATMCD has two key agents: a Data Augmentation agent that retrieves and processes modality-augmented data, and a Causal Constraint agent that integrates multi-modal data for knowledge-driven reasoning. The proposed design of the inner-workings ensures successful cooperation of the agents. Our empirical study across seven datasets suggests the significant potential of multi-modality enhanced causal discovery.</p></details> |  |

Existing rule-based or LLM-based evaluators often miss dangers in agents' step-by-step actions, overlook subtle meanings, fail to see how small issues compound, and get confused by unclear safety or security rules. To overcome this evaluation crisis, we introduce \sys, a universal, training-free, memory-augmented reasoning framework that empowers LLM evaluators to emulate human expert evaluators. \sys constructs an experiential memory by having an LLM adaptively extract structured semantic features (e.g., scenario, risk, behavior) and generate associated chain-of-thought reasoning traces for past interactions. A multi-stage, context-aware retrieval-augmented generation process then dynamically retrieves the most relevant reasoning experiences to guide the LLM evaluator's assessment of new cases. Moreover, we developed \data, the first benchmark designed to check how well LLM-based evaluators can spot both safety risks and security threats. \data comprises \textbf{2293} meticulously annotated interaction records, covering \textbf{15} risk types across \textbf{29} application scenarios. A key feature of \data is its nuanced approach to ambiguous risk situations, employing ``Strict'' and ``Lenient'' judgment standards. Experiments demonstrate that \sys not only consistently improves the evaluation performance of LLMs across all benchmarks but also sets a new state-of-the-art in LLM-as-a-judge for agent safety and security, achieving human-level accuracy. Our work is openly openly accessible.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks lack the ability to automatically evaluate from users' perspective, and also lack the explainability of the results of LLM agents' code generation capabilities. Thus, we introduce ProjectEval, a new benchmark for LLM agents project-level code generation's automated evaluation by simulating user interaction. ProjectEval is constructed by LLM with human reviewing. It has three different level inputs of natural languages or code skeletons. ProjectEval can evaluate the generated projects by user interaction simulation for execution, and by code similarity through existing objective indicators. Through ProjectEval, we find that systematic engineering project code, overall understanding of the project and comprehensive analysis capability are the keys for LLM agents to achieve practical projects. Our findings and benchmark provide valuable insights for developing more effective programming agents that can be deployed in future real-world production.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages (9 Appendix pages), 4 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

While retrieval augmented generation (RAG) shows great promise in large language model (LLM) based automated question answering, previous works often isolate neural and symbolic retrieval despite their complementary strengths. Moreover, conventional single-view chunking neglects the rich structure and layout of PDFs, e.g., sections and tables. In this work, we propose NeuSym-RAG, a hybrid neural symbolic retrieval framework which combines both paradigms in an interactive process. By leveraging multi-view chunking and schema-based parsing, NeuSym-RAG organizes semi-structured PDF content into both the relational database and vectorstore, enabling LLM agents to iteratively gather context until sufficient to generate answers. Experiments on three full PDF-based QA datasets, including a self-annotated one AIRQA-REAL, show that NeuSym-RAG stably defeats both the vector-based RAG and various structured baselines, highlighting its capacity to unify both retrieval schemes and utilize multiple views. Code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/X-LANCE/NeuSym-RAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 11 figures, 12 tables, accepted to ACL 2025 Long Main</p></details> |

However, concerns about the potential leakage of knowledge files have grown significantly. Existing studies demonstrate that adversarial prompts can induce GPTs to leak knowledge file content. Yet, it remains uncertain whether additional leakage vectors exist, particularly given the complex data flows across clients, servers, and databases in GPTs. In this paper, we present a comprehensive risk assessment of knowledge file leakage, leveraging a novel workflow inspired by Data Security Posture Management (DSPM). Through the analysis of 651,022 GPT metadata, 11,820 flows, and 1,466 responses, we identify five leakage vectors: metadata, GPT initialization, retrieval, sandboxed execution environments, and prompts. These vectors enable adversaries to extract sensitive knowledge file data such as titles, content, types, and sizes. Notably, the activation of the built-in tool Code Interpreter leads to a privilege escalation vulnerability, enabling adversaries to directly download original knowledge files with a 95.95% success rate. Further analysis reveals that 28.80% of leaked files are copyrighted, including digital copies from major publishers and internal materials from a listed company. In the end, we provide actionable solutions for GPT builders and platform providers to secure the GPT data supply chain.</p></details> |  |

Especially with the raise of DeepSeek R1 and V3 models, LLMs should enable a more engaging experience for human players in LLM-agent-based social deduction games like Werewolf. Previous works either fine-tuning, advanced prompting engineering, or additional experience pool to achieve engaging text-format Werewolf game experience. We propose a novel yet straightforward LLM-based Werewolf game system with tuned Text-to-Speech(TTS) models designed for enhanced compatibility with various LLM models, and improved user engagement. We argue with ever enhancing LLM reasoning, extra components will be unnecessary in the case of Werewolf.</p></details> |  |

While modern multimodal LLM agents have demonstrated impressive performance in static perception tasks, their ability to handle interactive, multi-step reasoning challenges like CAPTCHAs is largely untested. To address this gap, we introduce Open CaptchaWorld, the first web-based benchmark and platform specifically designed to evaluate the visual reasoning and interaction capabilities of MLLM-powered agents through diverse and dynamic CAPTCHA puzzles. Our benchmark spans 20 modern CAPTCHA types, totaling 225 CAPTCHAs, annotated with a new metric we propose: CAPTCHA Reasoning Depth, which quantifies the number of cognitive and motor steps required to solve each puzzle. Experimental results show that humans consistently achieve near-perfect scores, state-of-the-art MLLM agents struggle significantly, with success rates at most 40.0% by Browser-Use Openai-o3, far below human-level performance, 93.3%. This highlights Open CaptchaWorld as a vital benchmark for diagnosing the limits of current multimodal agents and guiding the development of more robust multimodal reasoning systems.

However, medical LDM training typically relies on performance- or scientific accessibility-limiting strategies including a reliance on short-prompt text encoders, the reuse of non-medical LDMs, or a requirement for fine-tuning with large data volumes. We propose a Class-Conditioned Efficient Large Language model Adapter (CCELLA) to address these limitations. CCELLA is a novel dual-head conditioning approach that simultaneously conditions the LDM U-Net with non-medical large language model-encoded text features through cross-attention and with pathology classification through the timestep embedding. We also propose a joint loss function and a data-efficient LDM training framework. In combination, these strategies enable pathology-conditioned LDM training for high-quality medical image synthesis given limited data volume and human data annotation, improving LDM performance and scientific accessibility. Our method achieves a 3D FID score of 0.025 on a size-limited prostate MRI dataset, significantly outperforming a recent foundation model with FID 0.071. When training a classifier for prostate cancer prediction, adding synthetic images generated by our method to the training dataset improves classifier accuracy from 69% to 74%. Training a classifier solely on our method's synthetic images achieved comparable performance to training on real images alone.</p></details> | <details><summary>MAH a...</summary><p>MAH and BT are co-senior authors on the work.

Unfortunately, existing screening techniques require expensive and intrusive medical procedures, not globally available, resulting in too many lost would-be-saved lives. We present CATCH-FM, CATch Cancer early with Healthcare Foundation Models, a cancer pre-screening methodology that identifies high-risk patients for further screening solely based on their historical medical records. With millions of electronic healthcare records (EHR), we establish the scaling law of EHR foundation models pretrained on medical code sequences, pretrain compute-optimal foundation models of up to 2.4 billion parameters, and finetune them on clinician-curated cancer risk prediction cohorts. In our retrospective evaluation comprising of thirty thousand patients, CATCH-FM achieved strong efficacy (60% sensitivity) with low risk (99% specificity and Negative Predictive Value), outperforming feature-based tree models as well as general and medical large language models by large margins. Despite significant demographic, healthcare system, and EHR coding differences, CATCH-FM achieves state-of-the-art pancreatic cancer risk prediction on the EHRSHOT few-shot leaderboard, outperforming EHR foundation models pretrained using on-site patient data. Our analysis demonstrates the robustness of CATCH-FM in various patient distributions, the benefits of operating in the ICD code space, and its ability to capture non-trivial cancer risk factors. Our code will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disentangling Reasoning and Knowledge in Medical Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11462v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) aims to emulate clinicians' diagnostic thinking, but current benchmarks such as MedQA-USMLE, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA often mix reasoning with factual recall. We address this by separating 11 biomedical QA benchmarks into reasoning- and knowledge-focused subsets using a PubMedBERT classifier that reaches 81 percent accuracy, comparable to human performance. Our analysis shows that only 32.8 percent of questions require complex reasoning. We evaluate biomedical models (HuatuoGPT-o1, MedReason, m1) and general-domain models (DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini, Qwen3), finding consistent gaps between knowledge and reasoning performance. For example, m1 scores 60.5 on knowledge but only 47.1 on reasoning. In adversarial tests where models are misled with incorrect initial reasoning, biomedical models degrade sharply, while larger or RL-trained general models show more robustness. To address this, we train BioMed-R1 using fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on reasoning-heavy examples. It achieves the strongest performance among similarly sized models. Further gains may come from incorporating clinical case reports and training with adversarial and backtracking scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[MRD-RAG: Enhancing Medical Diagnosis with Multi-Round Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07724v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, accurately and quickly deploying medical large language models (LLMs) has become a significant trend. Among these, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has garnered significant attention due to its features of rapid deployment and privacy protection. However, existing medical RAG frameworks still have shortcomings. Most existing medical RAG frameworks are designed for single-round question answering tasks and are not suitable for multi-round diagnostic dialogue. On the other hand, existing medical multi-round RAG frameworks do not consider the interconnections between potential diseases to inquire precisely like a doctor. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Round Diagnostic RAG (MRD-RAG) framework that mimics the doctor's diagnostic process. This RAG framework can analyze diagnosis information of potential diseases and accurately conduct multi-round diagnosis like a doctor. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed frameworks, we conduct experiments on two modern medical datasets and two traditional Chinese medicine datasets, with evaluations by GPT and human doctors on different methods. The results indicate that our RAG framework can significantly enhance the diagnostic performance of LLMs, highlighting the potential of our approach in medical diagnosis. The code and data can be found in our project website https://github.com/YixiangCh/MRD-RAG/tree/master.</p></details> |  |

It combines real-world clinical ECG data with systematically generated synthetic cases, covering 12 essential diagnostic tasks and totaling 47,211 expert-validated QA pairs. These encompass diverse clinical scenarios, from basic rhythm recognition to complex diagnoses involving rare conditions and temporal changes. A key innovation is the support for multi-turn dialogues, enabling the development of conversational medical AI systems that emulate clinician-patient or interprofessional interactions. This allows for more realistic assessment of AI models' clinical reasoning, diagnostic accuracy, and knowledge integration. Constructed through a knowledge-guided framework with strict quality control, ECG-Expert-QA ensures linguistic and clinical consistency, making it a high-quality resource for advancing AI-assisted ECG interpretation. It challenges models with tasks like identifying subtle ischemic changes and interpreting complex arrhythmias in context-rich scenarios.

The rise of assistive technologies like ambient dictation, which automatically generates draft notes from live patient encounters, has the potential to introduce additional noise making it crucial to assess the ability of LLM's to filter relevant data. To investigate this, we developed MedDistractQA, a benchmark using USMLE-style questions embedded with simulated real-world distractions. Our findings show that distracting statements (polysemous words with clinical meanings used in a non-clinical context or references to unrelated health conditions) can reduce LLM accuracy by up to 17.9%. Commonly proposed solutions to improve model performance such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and medical fine-tuning did not change this effect and in some cases introduced their own confounders and further degraded performance. Our findings suggest that LLMs natively lack the logical mechanisms necessary to distinguish relevant from irrelevant clinical information, posing challenges for real-world applications. MedDistractQA and our results highlights the need for robust mitigation strategies to enhance LLM resilience to extraneous information.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 2 main figures, 6 extended figures</p></details> |

Moreover, these LLMs typically have several billions of parameters, making them computationally expensive for healthcare systems. Thus, in this study, we propose CancerLLM, a model with 7 billion parameters and a Mistral-style architecture, pre-trained on nearly 2.7M clinical notes and over 515K pathology reports covering 17 cancer types, followed by fine-tuning on two cancer-relevant tasks, including cancer phenotypes extraction and cancer diagnosis generation. Our evaluation demonstrated that the CancerLLM achieves state-of-the-art results with F1 score of 91.78% on phenotyping extraction and 86.81% on disganois generation. It outperformed existing LLMs, with an average F1 score improvement of 9.23%.

This paper introduces MedHallBench, a comprehensive benchmark framework for evaluating and mitigating hallucinations in MLLMs. Our methodology integrates expert-validated medical case scenarios with established medical databases to create a robust evaluation dataset. The framework employs a sophisticated measurement system that combines automated ACHMI (Automatic Caption Hallucination Measurement in Medical Imaging) scoring with rigorous clinical expert evaluations and utilizes reinforcement learning methods to achieve automatic annotation. Through an optimized reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) training pipeline specifically designed for medical applications, MedHallBench enables thorough evaluation of MLLMs across diverse clinical contexts while maintaining stringent accuracy standards. We conducted comparative experiments involving various models, utilizing the benchmark to establish a baseline for widely adopted large language models (LLMs). Our findings indicate that ACHMI provides a more nuanced understanding of the effects of hallucinations compared to traditional metrics, thereby highlighting its advantages in hallucination assessment. This research establishes a foundational framework for enhancing MLLMs' reliability in healthcare settings and presents actionable strategies for addressing the critical challenge of AI hallucinations in medical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published to AAAI-25 Bridge Program</p></details> |
| **[Medical Large Language Model Benchmarks Should Prioritize Construct Validity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10694v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical large language models (LLMs) research often makes bold claims, from encoding clinical knowledge to reasoning like a physician. These claims are usually backed by evaluation on competitive benchmarks; a tradition inherited from mainstream machine learning. But how do we separate real progress from a leaderboard flex? Medical LLM benchmarks, much like those in other fields, are arbitrarily constructed using medical licensing exam questions. For these benchmarks to truly measure progress, they must accurately capture the real-world tasks they aim to represent. In this position paper, we argue that medical LLM benchmarks should (and indeed can) be empirically evaluated for their construct validity. In the psychological testing literature, "construct validity" refers to the ability of a test to measure an underlying "construct", that is the actual conceptual target of evaluation. By drawing an analogy between LLM benchmarks and psychological tests, we explain how frameworks from this field can provide empirical foundations for validating benchmarks. To put these ideas into practice, we use real-world clinical data in proof-of-concept experiments to evaluate popular medical LLM benchmarks and report significant gaps in their construct validity. Finally, we outline a vision for a new ecosystem of medical LLM evaluation centered around the creation of valid benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Chinese Medical LLMs: A Medbench-based Analysis of Performance Gaps and Hierarchical Optimization Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07306v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evaluation and improvement of medical large language models (LLMs) are critical for their real-world deployment, particularly in ensuring accuracy, safety, and ethical alignment. Existing frameworks inadequately dissect domain-specific error patterns or address cross-modal challenges. This study introduces a granular error taxonomy through systematic analysis of top 10 models on MedBench, categorizing incorrect responses into eight types: Omissions, Hallucination, Format Mismatch, Causal Reasoning Deficiency, Contextual Inconsistency, Unanswered, Output Error, and Deficiency in Medical Language Generation. Evaluation of 10 leading models reveals vulnerabilities: despite achieving 0.86 accuracy in medical knowledge recall, critical reasoning tasks show 96.3% omission, while safety ethics evaluations expose alarming inconsistency (robustness score: 0.79) under option shuffled. Our analysis uncovers systemic weaknesses in knowledge boundary enforcement and multi-step reasoning. To address these, we propose a tiered optimization strategy spanning four levels, from prompt engineering and knowledge-augmented retrieval to hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures and causal reasoning frameworks. This work establishes an actionable roadmap for developing clinically robust LLMs while redefining evaluation paradigms through error-driven insights, ultimately advancing the safety and trustworthiness of AI in high-stakes medical environments.</p></details> |  |

While deep learning (DL) shows promise in LDCT reconstruction, it requires large-scale data collection from multiple clients, raising privacy concerns. Federated learning (FL) has been introduced to address these privacy concerns; however, current methods are typically tailored to specific scanning protocols, which limits their generalizability and makes them less effective for unseen protocols. To address these issues, we propose SCAN-PhysFed, a novel SCanning- and ANatomy-level personalized Physics-Driven Federated learning paradigm for LDCT reconstruction. Since the noise distribution in LDCT data is closely tied to scanning protocols and anatomical structures being scanned, we design a dual-level physics-informed way to address these challenges. Specifically, we incorporate physical and anatomical prompts into our physics-informed hypernetworks to capture scanning- and anatomy-specific information, enabling dual-level physics-driven personalization of imaging features. These prompts are derived from the scanning protocol and the radiology report generated by a medical large language model (MLLM), respectively. Subsequently, client-specific decoders project these dual-level personalized imaging features back into the image domain. Besides, to tackle the challenge of unseen data, we introduce a novel protocol vector-quantization strategy (PVQS), which ensures consistent performance across new clients by quantifying the unseen scanning code as one of the codes in the scanning codebook. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of SCAN-PhysFed on public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

To address this, we first construct a high-quality medical dataset and conduct analysis to ensure its quality. In order to leverage the generalization capability of multilingual LLMs to efficiently scale to more resource-constrained languages, we explore the internal information flow of LLMs from a multilingual perspective using Mixture of Experts (MoE) modularity. Technically, we propose a novel MoE routing method that employs language-specific experts and cross-lingual routing. Inspired by circuit theory, our routing analysis revealed a Spread Out in the End information flow mechanism: while earlier layers concentrate cross-lingual information flow, the later layers exhibit language-specific divergence. This insight directly led to the development of the Post-MoE architecture, which applies sparse routing only in the later layers while maintaining dense others. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach enhances the generalization of multilingual models to other languages while preserving interpretability. Finally, to efficiently scale the model to 50 languages, we introduce the concept of language family experts, drawing on linguistic priors, which enables scaling the number of languages without adding additional parameters.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose the Incremental Curriculum-Based Fine-Tuning (ICFT) framework to enhance the generative capabilities of medical large language models (MLLMs). ICFT combines curriculum-based learning, dual-stage memory coordination, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning to enable a progressive transition from general linguistic knowledge to strong domain-specific expertise. Experimental results across diverse medical NLP tasks, including question answering, preference classification, and response generation, demonstrate that ICFT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving improvements in both accuracy and efficiency. Further analysis reveals the framework's ability to generalize to unseen data, reduce errors, and deliver diverse, contextually relevant medical responses. These findings establish ICFT as a robust and scalable solution for adapting LLMs to the medical domain, offering practical benefits for real-world healthcare applications.</p></details> |  |

Experimental results demonstrate that the federated learning-based models integrated with RAG systems consistently outperform their non-integrated counterparts across all evaluation metrics. This study highlights the potential of combining federated learning and RAG systems for developing domain-specific LLMs in the medical field, providing a scalable and privacy-preserving solution for enhancing text generation capabilities.</p></details> |  |

We emphasise the importance of understanding reasoning behaviour as opposed to high-level prediction accuracies, since it is equivalent to explainable AI (XAI) in this context. In particular, achieving XAI in medical LLMs used in the clinical domain will have a significant impact across the healthcare sector. Results: Therefore, we define the concept of reasoning behaviour in the specific context of medical LLMs. We then categorise and discuss the current state of the art of methods which evaluate reasoning behaviour in medical LLMs. Finally, we propose theoretical frameworks which can empower medical professionals or machine learning engineers to gain insight into the low-level reasoning operations of these previously obscure models. Conclusion: The subsequent increased transparency and trust in medical machine learning models by clinicians as well as patients will accelerate the integration, application as well as further development of medical AI for the healthcare system as a whole</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables.

Considering this rapid technical progress, in this survey, we trace the recent advances of Medical Large Language Models (Med-LLMs), including the background, key findings, and mainstream techniques, especially for the evolution from general-purpose models to medical-specialized applications. Firstly, we delve into the foundational technology of Med-LLMs, indicating how general models can be progressively adapted and refined for the complicated medical tasks. Secondly, the wide-ranging applications of Med-LLMs are investigated across various healthcare domains, as well as an up-to-date review of existing Med-LLMs. The transformative impact of these models on daily medical practice is evident through their ability to assist clinicians, educators, and patients. Recognizing the importance of responsible innovation, we discuss the challenges associated with ensuring fairness, accountability, privacy, and robustness. Ethical considerations, rigorous evaluation methodologies, and the establishment of regulatory frameworks are crucial for building trustworthiness in the real-world system. We emphasize the need for ongoing scrutiny and development to maintain high standards of safety and reliability. Finally, we anticipate possible future trajectories for Med-LLMs, identifying key avenues for prudent expansion. By consolidating these insights, our review aims to provide professionals and researchers with a thorough understanding of the strengths and limitations of Med-LLMs, fostering a balanced and ethical approach to their integration into the healthcare ecosystem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Foundation Models for Critical Care Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16346v1)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Notable progress has been made in generalist medical large language models across various healthcare areas. However, large-scale modeling of in-hospital time series data - such as vital signs, lab results, and treatments in critical care - remains underexplored. Existing datasets are relatively small, but combining them can enhance patient diversity and improve model robustness. To effectively utilize these combined datasets for large-scale modeling, it is essential to address the distribution shifts caused by varying treatment policies, necessitating the harmonization of treatment variables across the different datasets. This work aims to establish a foundation for training large-scale multi-variate time series models on critical care data and to provide a benchmark for machine learning models in transfer learning across hospitals to study and address distribution shift challenges. We introduce a harmonized dataset for sequence modeling and transfer learning research, representing the first large-scale collection to include core treatment variables. Future plans involve expanding this dataset to support further advancements in transfer learning and the development of scalable, generalizable models for critical healthcare applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Oral Presentation at AIM-FM Workshop at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Leveraging their generative capabilities has the potential to enhance the level and quality of medical services. In response to the limitations of current large language models, which often struggle with accuracy and have narrow capabilities in medical applications, this paper presents a Chinese medical large language model, MedGo. MedGo was trained using a combination of high quality unsupervised medical data, supervised data, and preference alignment data, aimed at enhancing both its versatility and precision in medical tasks. The model was evaluated through the public CBLUE benchmark and a manually constructed dataset ClinicalQA. The results demonstrate that MedGo achieved promising performance across various Chinese medical information processing tasks, achieved the first place in the CBLUE evaluation. Additionally, on our constructed dataset ClinicalQA, MedGo outperformed its base model Qwen2, highlighting its potential to improve both automated medical question answering and clinical decision support. These experimental results demonstrate that MedGo possesses strong information processing capabilities in the medical field.

Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) leverages LLMs to organize RAG data into graphs, showing strong potential for gaining holistic insights from long-form documents. However, its standard implementation is overly complex for general use and lacks the ability to generate evidence-based responses, limiting its effectiveness in the medical field. To extend the capabilities of GraphRAG to the medical domain, we propose unique Triple Graph Construction and U-Retrieval techniques over it. In our graph construction, we create a triple-linked structure that connects user documents to credible medical sources and controlled vocabularies. In the retrieval process, we propose U-Retrieval which combines Top-down Precise Retrieval with Bottom-up Response Refinement to balance global context awareness with precise indexing. These effort enable both source information retrieval and comprehensive response generation. Our approach is validated on 9 medical Q\&A benchmarks, 2 health fact-checking benchmarks, and one collected dataset testing long-form generation. The results show that MedGraphRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across all benchmarks, while also ensuring that responses include credible source documentation and definitions.

We present CliMedBench, a comprehensive benchmark with 14 expert-guided core clinical scenarios specifically designed to assess the medical ability of LLMs across 7 pivot dimensions. It comprises 33,735 questions derived from real-world medical reports of top-tier tertiary hospitals and authentic examination exercises. The reliability of this benchmark has been confirmed in several ways. Subsequent experiments with existing LLMs have led to the following findings: (i) Chinese medical LLMs underperform on this benchmark, especially where medical reasoning and factual consistency are vital, underscoring the need for advances in clinical knowledge and diagnostic accuracy. (ii) Several general-domain LLMs demonstrate substantial potential in medical clinics, while the limited input capacity of many medical LLMs hinders their practical use. These findings reveal both the strengths and limitations of LLMs in clinical scenarios and offer critical insights for medical research.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ENMLP-2024</p></details> |
| **[Editing Factual Knowledge and Explanatory Ability of Medical Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18099v3)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model editing aims to precisely alter the behaviors of large language models (LLMs) in relation to specific knowledge, while leaving unrelated knowledge intact. This approach has proven effective in addressing issues of hallucination and outdated information in LLMs. However, the potential of using model editing to modify knowledge in the medical field remains largely unexplored, even though resolving hallucination is a pressing need in this area. Our observations indicate that current methods face significant challenges in dealing with specialized and complex knowledge in medical domain. Therefore, we propose MedLaSA, a novel Layer-wise Scalable Adapter strategy for medical model editing. MedLaSA harnesses the strengths of both adding extra parameters and locate-then-edit methods for medical model editing. We utilize causal tracing to identify the association of knowledge in neurons across different layers, and generate a corresponding scale set from the association value for each piece of knowledge. Subsequently, we incorporate scalable adapters into the dense layers of LLMs. These adapters are assigned scaling values based on the corresponding specific knowledge, which allows for the adjustment of the adapter's weight and rank. The more similar the content, the more consistent the scale between them. This ensures precise editing of semantically identical knowledge while avoiding impact on unrelated knowledge. To evaluate the editing impact on the behaviours of LLMs, we propose two model editing studies for medical domain: (1) editing factual knowledge for medical specialization and (2) editing the explanatory ability for complex knowledge. We build two novel medical benchmarking datasets and introduce a series of challenging and comprehensive metrics. Extensive experiments on medical LLMs demonstrate the editing efficiency of MedLaSA, without affecting unrelated knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2024</p></details> |

Particularly in the healthcare industry, there is an increasing demand for locally operated LLMs due to security concerns. However, the majority of high quality open-source LLMs have a size of 70B parameters, imposing significant financial burdens on users for GPU preparation and operation. To overcome these issues, we present a medical adaptation based on the recent 7B models, which enables the operation in low computational resources. We compare the performance on medical question-answering benchmarks in two languages (Japanese and English), demonstrating that its scores reach parity with or surpass those of currently existing medical LLMs that are ten times larger. We find that fine-tuning an English-centric base model on Japanese medical dataset improves the score in both language, supporting the effect of cross-lingual knowledge transfer. We hope that this study will alleviate financial challenges, serving as a stepping stone for clinical institutions to practically utilize LLMs locally.

Adapting generic LLMs for healthcare often requires continual pretraining, but this approach is computationally expensive and sometimes impractical. Instruction fine-tuning on a specific task may not always guarantee optimal performance due to the lack of broader domain knowledge that the model needs to understand and reason effectively in diverse scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce two multilingual instruction fine-tuning datasets, MMed-IFT and MMed-IFT-MC, containing over 200k high-quality medical samples in six languages. We propose a two-stage training paradigm: the first stage injects general medical knowledge using MMed-IFT, while the second stage fine-tunes task-specific multiple-choice questions with MMed-IFT-MC. Our method achieves competitive results on both English and multilingual benchmarks, striking a balance between computational efficiency and performance.

With big data, especially texts, forming the foundation of medical services, there is an exigent need for effective natural language processing (NLP) solutions tailored to the healthcare domain. Conventional approaches leveraging pre-trained models present promising results in this domain and current large language models (LLMs) offer advanced foundation for medical text processing. However, most medical LLMs are trained only with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), even though it efficiently empowers LLMs to understand and respond to medical instructions but is ineffective in learning domain knowledge and aligning with human preference. In this work, we propose ChiMed-GPT, a new benchmark LLM designed explicitly for Chinese medical domain, and undergoes a comprehensive training regime with pre-training, SFT, and RLHF. Evaluations on tasks including information extraction, question answering, and dialogue generation demonstrate ChiMed-GPT's superior performance over general domain LLMs. Furthermore, we analyze possible biases through prompting ChiMed-GPT to perform attitude scales regarding discrimination of patients, so as to contribute to further responsible development of LLMs in the medical domain.

Pre-training LLMs from scratch for domains like medicine is resource-heavy and often unfeasible. On the other hand, sole reliance on Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) can result in overconfident predictions and may not tap into domain-specific insights. In response, we present a multi-stage training method combining Domain-specific Continued Pre-training (DCPT), SFT, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In addition, we publish a 3Gb Chinese Medicine (ChiMed) dataset, encompassing medical question answering, plain texts, knowledge graphs, and dialogues, segmented into three training stages. The medical LLM trained with our pipeline, Qilin-Med, shows substantial performance improvement. In the CPT and SFT phases, Qilin-Med achieved 38.4% and 40.0% accuracy on the CMExam test set, respectively. It outperformed the basemodel Baichuan-7B (accuracy: 33.5%), by 7.5%. In the DPO phase, it scored 16.66 in BLEU-1 and 27.44 in ROUGE-1 on the Huatuo-26M test set, bringing further improvement to the SFT phase (12.69 in BLEU-1 and 24.21 in ROUGE-1). Additionally, we have further enhanced the model's performance through the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. Experiments demonstrate that Qilin-Med-RAG achieves an accuracy rate of 42.8% on CMExam.

Despite advancements, challenges persist due to the complexity and diversity inherent in medical tasks which often require multi-task learning capabilities. Previous approaches, although beneficial, fall short in real-world applications because they necessitate task-specific annotations at inference time, limiting broader generalization. This paper introduces MING-MOE, a novel Mixture-of-Expert~(MOE)-based medical large language model designed to manage diverse and complex medical tasks without requiring task-specific annotations, thus enhancing its usability across extensive datasets. MING-MOE employs a Mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation (MoLoRA) technique, allowing for efficient parameter usage by maintaining base model parameters static while adapting through a minimal set of trainable parameters. We demonstrate that MING-MOE achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on over 20 medical tasks, illustrating a significant improvement over existing models. This approach not only extends the capabilities of medical language models but also improves inference efficiency.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |

However, most existing research focuses on general medicine, and there is a need for in-depth study of LLMs in specific fields like anesthesiology. To fill the gap, we introduce Hypnos, a Chinese Anesthesia model built upon existing LLMs, e.g., Llama. Hypnos' contributions have three aspects: 1) The data, such as utilizing Self-Instruct, acquired from current LLMs likely includes inaccuracies. Hypnos implements a cross-filtering strategy to improve the data quality. This strategy involves using one LLM to assess the quality of the generated data from another LLM and filtering out the data with low quality. 2) Hypnos employs a general-to-specific training strategy that starts by fine-tuning LLMs using the general medicine data and subsequently improving the fine-tuned LLMs using data specifically from Anesthesiology. The general medical data supplement the medical expertise in Anesthesiology and enhance the effectiveness of Hypnos' generation. 3) We introduce a standardized benchmark for evaluating medical LLM in Anesthesiology. Our benchmark includes both publicly available instances from the Internet and privately obtained cases from the Hospital. Hypnos outperforms other medical LLMs in anesthesiology in metrics, GPT-4, and human evaluation on the benchmark dataset.</p></details> |  |

MedBench replicates the educational progression and clinical practice experiences of doctors in Mainland China, thereby establishing itself as a credible benchmark for assessing the mastery of knowledge and reasoning abilities in medical language learning models. We perform extensive experiments and conduct an in-depth analysis from diverse perspectives, which culminate in the following findings: (1) Chinese medical LLMs underperform on this benchmark, highlighting the need for significant advances in clinical knowledge and diagnostic precision. (2) Several general-domain LLMs surprisingly possess considerable medical knowledge.

LLM-driven data science agents promise to automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing work.

To bridge this, we introduce Farseer, a novel and refined scaling law offering enhanced predictive accuracy across scales. By systematically constructing a model loss surface $L(N,D)$, Farseer achieves a significantly better fit to empirical data than prior laws (e.g., Chinchilla's law). Our methodology yields accurate, robust, and highly generalizable predictions, demonstrating excellent extrapolation capabilities, improving upon Chinchilla's law by reducing extrapolation error by 433\%. This allows for the reliable evaluation of competing training strategies across all $(N,D)$ settings, enabling conclusions from small-scale ablation studies to be confidently extrapolated to predict large-scale performance. Furthermore, Farseer provides new insights into optimal compute allocation, better reflecting the nuanced demands of modern LLM training. To validate our approach, we trained an extensive suite of approximately 1,000 LLMs across diverse scales and configurations, consuming roughly 3 million NVIDIA H100 GPU hours. We are comprehensively open-sourcing all models, data, results, and logs at https://github.com/Farseer-Scaling-Law/Farseer to foster further research.</p></details> | 34 |

Many works aim to address this issue by removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner, which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy.

We present a comprehensive, professionally annotated benchmark for Chinese content harm detection, which covers six representative categories and is constructed entirely from real-world data. Our annotation process further yields a knowledge rule base that provides explicit expert knowledge to assist LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection. In addition, we propose a knowledge-augmented baseline that integrates both human-annotated knowledge rules and implicit knowledge from large language models, enabling smaller models to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ChineseHarm-bench.</p></details> | Work in progress |

However, the traditional process for creating such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and validating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers. Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example, with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection, and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall of 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training and evaluation.

While holding tremendous promise for automating complex web interactions, current approaches face substantial challenges due to the fundamental mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities. Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions. This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research: rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface (AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety, efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving the broader ML community.</p></details> |  |

While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive code generation capabilities, they typically do not utilize execution feedback during inference, a critical signal that human programmers regularly leverage. Our method, Execution-Guided Classifier-Free Guidance (EG-CFG), dynamically incorporates execution signals as the model generates code, providing line-by-line feedback that guides the generation process toward executable solutions. EG-CFG employs a multi-stage process: first, we conduct beam search to sample candidate program completions for each line; second, we extract execution signals by executing these candidates against test cases; and finally, we incorporate these signals into the prompt during generation. By maintaining consistent signals across tokens within the same line and refreshing signals at line boundaries, our approach provides coherent guidance while preserving syntactic structure. Moreover, the method naturally supports native parallelism at the task level in which multiple agents operate in parallel, exploring diverse reasoning paths and collectively generating a broad set of candidate solutions. Our experiments across diverse coding tasks demonstrate that EG-CFG significantly improves code generation performance compared to standard approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results across various levels of complexity, from foundational problems to challenging competitive programming tasks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/boazlavon/eg_cfg</p></details> |  |

However, a key challenge in LLM unlearning is unintended forgetting, where the removal of specific data inadvertently impairs the utility of the model and its retention of valuable, desired information. While prior work has primarily focused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on unlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods often suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To address this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And Retention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight proxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the "alignment" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally efficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that assigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely proportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of unlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly enhances retention while maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods. Extensive experiments on the TOFU benchmark across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that GUARD substantially improves utility preservation while ensuring effective unlearning. Notably, GUARD reduces utility sacrifice on the Retain Set by up to 194.92% in terms of Truth Ratio when forgetting 10% of the training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Adapting Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10943v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are powerful but static; they lack mechanisms to adapt their weights in response to new tasks, knowledge, or examples. We introduce Self-Adapting LLMs (SEAL), a framework that enables LLMs to self-adapt by generating their own finetuning data and update directives. Given a new input, the model produces a self-edit-a generation that may restructure the information in different ways, specify optimization hyperparameters, or invoke tools for data augmentation and gradient-based updates. Through supervised finetuning (SFT), these self-edits result in persistent weight updates, enabling lasting adaptation. To train the model to produce effective self-edits, we use a reinforcement learning loop with the downstream performance of the updated model as the reward signal. Unlike prior approaches that rely on separate adaptation modules or auxiliary networks, SEAL directly uses the model's own generation to control its adaptation process. Experiments on knowledge incorporation and few-shot generalization show that SEAL is a promising step toward language models capable of self-directed adaptation.

| **[Dynamic Epistemic Friction in Dialogue](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10934v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences have significantly enhanced their utility in human-AI collaborative scenarios. However, such approaches often neglect the critical role of "epistemic friction," or the inherent resistance encountered when updating beliefs in response to new, conflicting, or ambiguous information. In this paper, we define dynamic epistemic friction as the resistance to epistemic integration, characterized by the misalignment between an agent's current belief state and new propositions supported by external evidence. We position this within the framework of Dynamic Epistemic Logic (Van Benthem and Pacuit, 2011), where friction emerges as nontrivial belief-revision during the interaction. We then present analyses from a situated collaborative task that demonstrate how this model of epistemic friction can effectively predict belief updates in dialogues, and we subsequently discuss how the model of belief alignment as a measure of epistemic resistance or friction can naturally be made more sophisticated to accommodate the complexities of real-world dialogue scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables, CoNLL 2025</p></details> |
| **[LLM-Cure: LLM-based Competitor User Review Analysis for Feature Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15724v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exponential growth of the mobile app market underscores the importance of constant innovation and rapid response to user demands. As user satisfaction is paramount to the success of a mobile application (app), developers typically rely on user reviews, which represent user feedback that includes ratings and comments to identify areas for improvement. However, the sheer volume of user reviews poses challenges in manual analysis, necessitating automated approaches. Existing automated approaches either analyze only the target apps reviews, neglecting the comparison of similar features to competitors or fail to provide suggestions for feature enhancement. To address these gaps, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Competitive User Review Analysis for Feature Enhancement) (LLM-Cure), an approach powered by LLMs to automatically generate suggestion s for mobile app feature improvements. More specifically, LLM-Cure identifies and categorizes features within reviews by applying LLMs. When provided with a complaint in a user review, LLM-Cure curates highly rated (4 and 5 stars) reviews in competing apps related to the complaint and proposes potential improvements tailored to the target application. We evaluate LLM-Cure on 1,056,739 reviews of 70 popular Android apps. Our evaluation demonstrates that LLM-Cure significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in assigning features to reviews by up to 13% in F1-score, up to 16% in recall and up to 11% in precision. Additionally, LLM-Cure demonstrates its capability to provide suggestions for resolving user complaints. We verify the suggestions using the release notes that reflect the changes of features in the target mobile app. LLM-Cure achieves a promising average of 73% of the implementation of the provided suggestions.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[Improving LLM Safety Alignment with Dual-Objective Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03710v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing training-time safety alignment techniques for large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Direct preference optimization (DPO), a widely deployed alignment method, exhibits limitations in both experimental and theoretical contexts as its loss function proves suboptimal for refusal learning. Through gradient-based analysis, we identify these shortcomings and propose an improved safety alignment that disentangles DPO objectives into two components: (1) robust refusal training, which encourages refusal even when partial unsafe generations are produced, and (2) targeted unlearning of harmful knowledge. This approach significantly increases LLM robustness against a wide range of jailbreak attacks, including prefilling, suffix, and multi-turn attacks across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a method to emphasize critical refusal tokens by incorporating a reward-based token-level weighting mechanism for refusal learning, which further improves the robustness against adversarial exploits. Our research also suggests that robustness to jailbreak attacks is correlated with token distribution shifts in the training process and internal representations of refusal and harmful tokens, offering valuable directions for future research in LLM safety alignment.

| **[Investigating the Relationship Between Physical Activity and Tailored Behavior Change Messaging: Connecting Contextual Bandit with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07275v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning approaches, such as contextual multi-armed bandit (cMAB) algorithms, offer a promising strategy to reduce sedentary behavior by delivering personalized interventions to encourage physical activity. However, cMAB algorithms typically require large participant samples to learn effectively and may overlook key psychological factors that are not explicitly encoded in the model. In this study, we propose a hybrid approach that combines cMAB for selecting intervention types with large language models (LLMs) to personalize message content. We evaluate four intervention types: behavioral self-monitoring, gain-framed, loss-framed, and social comparison, each delivered as a motivational message aimed at increasing motivation for physical activity and daily step count. Message content is further personalized using dynamic contextual factors including daily fluctuations in self-efficacy, social influence, and regulatory focus. Over a seven-day trial, participants receive daily messages assigned by one of four models: cMAB alone, LLM alone, combined cMAB with LLM personalization (cMABxLLM), or equal randomization (RCT). Outcomes include daily step count and message acceptance, assessed via ecological momentary assessments (EMAs). We apply a causal inference framework to evaluate the effects of each model. Our findings offer new insights into the complementary roles of LLM-based personalization and cMAB adaptation in promoting physical activity through personalized behavioral messaging.</p></details> |  |

Generative AI (GAI) technologies, such as large language models (LLMs) and image generation tools, are increasingly integrated into applications aimed at enhancing human social experiences. Despite their growing presence, little is known about how these technologies influence social interactions. This scoping review investigates how GAI-based applications are currently designed to facilitate social interaction, what forms of social engagement they target, and which design and evaluation methodologies designers use to create and evaluate them. Through an analysis of 30 studies published since 2020, we identify key trends in application domains including storytelling, socio-emotional skills training, reminiscence, collaborative learning, music making, and general conversation. We highlight the role of participatory and co-design approaches in fostering both effective technology use and social engagement, while also examining socio-ethical concerns such as cultural bias and accessibility. This review underscores the potential of GAI to support dynamic and personalized interactions, but calls for greater attention to equitable design practices and inclusive evaluation strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version of a manuscript submitted to ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction (TOCHI), under review. 39 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Robustly Improving LLM Fairness in Realistic Settings via Interpretability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10922v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes hiring applications, making decisions that directly impact people's careers and livelihoods. While prior studies suggest simple anti-bias prompts can eliminate demographic biases in controlled evaluations, we find these mitigations fail when realistic contextual details are introduced. We address these failures through internal bias mitigation: by identifying and neutralizing sensitive attribute directions within model activations, we achieve robust bias reduction across all tested scenarios. Across leading commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 4 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash) and open-source models (Gemma-2 27B, Gemma-3, Mistral-24B), we find that adding realistic context such as company names, culture descriptions from public careers pages, and selective hiring constraints (e.g.,``only accept candidates in the top 10\%") induces significant racial and gender biases (up to 12\% differences in interview rates). When these biases emerge, they consistently favor Black over White candidates and female over male candidates across all tested models and scenarios. Moreover, models can infer demographics and become biased from subtle cues like college affiliations, with these biases remaining invisible even when inspecting the model's chain-of-thought reasoning. To address these limitations, our internal bias mitigation identifies race and gender-correlated directions and applies affine concept editing at inference time. Despite using directions from a simple synthetic dataset, the intervention generalizes robustly, consistently reducing bias to very low levels (typically under 1\%, always below 2.5\%) while largely maintaining model performance. Our findings suggest that practitioners deploying LLMs for hiring should adopt more realistic evaluation methodologies and consider internal mitigation strategies for equitable outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decomposing MLP Activations into Interpretable Features via Semi-Nonnegative Matrix Factorization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10920v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A central goal for mechanistic interpretability has been to identify the right units of analysis in large language models (LLMs) that causally explain their outputs. While early work focused on individual neurons, evidence that neurons often encode multiple concepts has motivated a shift toward analyzing directions in activation space. A key question is how to find directions that capture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner. Current methods rely on dictionary learning with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), commonly trained over residual stream activations to learn directions from scratch. However, SAEs often struggle in causal evaluations and lack intrinsic interpretability, as their learning is not explicitly tied to the computations of the model. Here, we tackle these limitations by directly decomposing MLP activations with semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF), such that the learned features are (a) sparse linear combinations of co-activated neurons, and (b) mapped to their activating inputs, making them directly interpretable. Experiments on Llama 3.1, Gemma 2 and GPT-2 show that SNMF derived features outperform SAEs and a strong supervised baseline (difference-in-means) on causal steering, while aligning with human-interpretable concepts. Further analysis reveals that specific neuron combinations are reused across semantically-related features, exposing a hierarchical structure in the MLP's activation space. Together, these results position SNMF as a simple and effective tool for identifying interpretable features and dissecting concept representations in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weak-to-Strong Jailbreaking on Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17256v3)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks - resulting in harmful, unethical, or biased text generations. However, existing jailbreaking methods are computationally costly. In this paper, we propose the weak-to-strong jailbreaking attack, an efficient inference time attack for aligned LLMs to produce harmful text. Our key intuition is based on the observation that jailbroken and aligned models only differ in their initial decoding distributions. The weak-to-strong attack's key technical insight is using two smaller models (a safe and an unsafe one) to adversarially modify a significantly larger safe model's decoding probabilities. We evaluate the weak-to-strong attack on 5 diverse open-source LLMs from 3 organizations. The results show our method can increase the misalignment rate to over 99% on two datasets with just one forward pass per example. Our study exposes an urgent safety issue that needs to be addressed when aligning LLMs. As an initial attempt, we propose a defense strategy to protect against such attacks, but creating more advanced defenses remains challenging. The code for replicating the method is available at https://github.com/XuandongZhao/weak-to-strong</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

Despite advances in molecular design and property prediction, the task of molecular toxicity repair - generating structurally valid molecular alternatives with reduced toxicity - has not yet been systematically defined or benchmarked. To fill this gap, we introduce ToxiMol, the first benchmark task for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on molecular toxicity repair. We construct a standardized dataset covering 11 primary tasks and 560 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse mechanisms and granularities. We design a prompt annotation pipeline with mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert toxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation framework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput evaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess nearly 30 mainstream general-purpose MLLMs and design multiple ablation studies to analyze key factors such as evaluation criteria, candidate diversity, and failure attribution. Experimental results show that although current MLLMs still face significant challenges on this task, they begin to demonstrate promising capabilities in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint adherence, and structure-aware molecule editing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficiently Identifying Watermarked Segments in Mixed-Source Texts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03600v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text watermarks in large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to detect synthetic text, mitigating misuse cases like fake news and academic dishonesty. While existing watermarking detection techniques primarily focus on classifying entire documents as watermarked or not, they often neglect the common scenario of identifying individual watermark segments within longer, mixed-source documents. Drawing inspiration from plagiarism detection systems, we propose two novel methods for partial watermark detection. First, we develop a geometry cover detection framework aimed at determining whether there is a watermark segment in long text. Second, we introduce an adaptive online learning algorithm to pinpoint the precise location of watermark segments within the text. Evaluated on three popular watermarking techniques (KGW-Watermark, Unigram-Watermark, and Gumbel-Watermark), our approach achieves high accuracy, significantly outperforming baseline methods. Moreover, our framework is adaptable to other watermarking techniques, offering new insights for precise watermark detection.

Scaling up these clusters is expensive and can become impractical, imposing limits on the size of models that can be trained. Several recent studies have proposed training methods that are less communication intensive, avoiding the need for a highly connected compute cluster. These state-of-the-art low communication training methods still employ a synchronization step for model parameters, which, when performed over all model replicas, can become costly on a low-bandwidth network. In this work, we propose a novel optimization method, NoLoCo, that does not explicitly synchronize all model parameters during training and, as a result, does not require any collective communication. NoLoCo implicitly synchronizes model weights via a novel variant of the Nesterov momentum optimizer by partially averaging model weights with a randomly selected other one. We provide both a theoretical convergence analysis for our proposed optimizer as well as empirical results from language model training. We benchmark NoLoCo on a wide range of accelerator counts and model sizes, between 125M to 6.8B parameters. Our method requires significantly less communication overhead than fully sharded data parallel training or even widely used low communication training method, DiLoCo. The synchronization step itself is estimated to be one magnitude faster than the all-reduce used in DiLoCo for few hundred accelerators training over the internet. We also do not have any global blocking communication that reduces accelerator idling time. Compared to DiLoCo, we also observe up to $4\%$ faster convergence rate with wide range of model sizes and accelerator counts.</p></details> |  |

We propose a method that supplements such "expert" labels with AI predictions from pre-trained models to construct labeled datasets more cost-effectively. Our approach results in probably approximately correct labels: with high probability, the overall labeling error is small. This solution enables rigorous yet efficient dataset curation using modern AI models. We demonstrate the benefits of the methodology through text annotation with large language models, image labeling with pre-trained vision models, and protein folding analysis with AlphaFold.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances using large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results, methods for automatically evaluating autoformalization remain underexplored. As one moves to more complex domains (e.g., advanced mathematics), human evaluation requires significant time and domain expertise, especially as the complexity of the underlying statements and background knowledge increases. LLM-as-a-judge presents a promising approach for automating such evaluation. However, existing methods typically employ coarse-grained and generic evaluation criteria, which limit their effectiveness for advanced formal mathematical reasoning, where quality hinges on nuanced, multi-granular dimensions. In this work, we take a step toward addressing this gap by introducing a systematic, automatic method to evaluate autoformalization tasks. The proposed method is based on an epistemically and formally grounded ensemble (EFG) of LLM judges, defined on criteria encompassing logical preservation (LP), mathematical consistency (MC), formal validity (FV), and formal quality (FQ), resulting in a transparent assessment that accounts for different contributing factors. We validate the proposed framework to serve as a proxy for autoformalization assessment within the domain of formal mathematics. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that the EFG ensemble of LLM judges is a suitable emerging proxy for evaluation, more strongly correlating with human assessments than a coarse-grained model, especially when assessing formal qualities. These findings suggest that LLM-as-judges, especially when guided by a well-defined set of atomic properties, could offer a scalable, interpretable, and reliable support for evaluating formal mathematical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces GenPlanX that integrates LLMs for natural language-based description of planning tasks, with a classical AI planning engine, alongside an execution and monitoring framework. We demonstrate the efficacy of GenPlanX in assisting users with office-related tasks, highlighting its potential to streamline workflows and enhance productivity through seamless human-AI collaboration.</p></details> |  |

Existing solutions rely on manual rewriting or labeled data for validation, making them inapplicable in true zero-shot settings. To address these challenges, we propose PLAY2PROMPT, an automated framework that systematically "plays" with each tool to explore its input-output behaviors. Through this iterative trial-and-error process, PLAY2PROMPT refines tool documentation and generates usage examples without any labeled data. These examples not only guide LLM inference but also serve as validation to further enhance tool utilization. Extensive experiments on real-world tasks demonstrate that PLAY2PROMPT significantly improves zero-shot tool performance across both open and closed models, offering a scalable and effective solution for domain-specific tool integration.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 Long Paper (Findings)</p></details> |

Understanding Out-of-Context Reasoning in Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10887v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning, but this process exhibits a puzzling duality: models can generalize remarkably from new facts, yet are also prone to hallucinating incorrect information. However, the reasons for this phenomenon remain poorly understood. In this work, we argue that both behaviors stem from a single mechanism known as out-of-context reasoning (OCR): the ability to deduce implications by associating concepts, even those without a causal link. Our experiments across five prominent LLMs confirm that OCR indeed drives both generalization and hallucination, depending on whether the associated concepts are causally related. To build a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon, we then formalize OCR as a synthetic factual recall task. We empirically show that a one-layer single-head attention-only transformer with factorized output and value matrices can learn to solve this task, while a model with combined weights cannot, highlighting the crucial role of matrix factorization. Our theoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the implicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the nuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix. This mathematical structure explains why the model learns to associate facts and implications with high sample efficiency, regardless of whether the correlation is causal or merely spurious. Ultimately, our work provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the OCR phenomenon, offering a new lens for analyzing and mitigating undesirable behaviors from knowledge injection.</p></details> |  |

As false information transcends linguistic boundaries, the ability to automatically detect previously fact-checked claims across languages has become an increasingly important task. This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of large language models (LLMs) for multilingual previously fact-checked claim detection. We assess seven LLMs across 20 languages in both monolingual and cross-lingual settings. Our results show that while LLMs perform well for high-resource languages, they struggle with low-resource languages. Moreover, translating original texts into English proved to be beneficial for low-resource languages. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs for multilingual previously fact-checked claim detection and provide a foundation for further research on this promising application of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Across these developments, a key unified paradigm has arisen: Learning from Rewards, where reward signals act as the guiding stars to steer LLM behavior. It has underpinned a wide range of prevalent techniques, such as reinforcement learning (RLHF, RLAIF, DPO, and GRPO), reward-guided decoding, and post-hoc correction. Crucially, this paradigm enables the transition from passive learning from static data to active learning from dynamic feedback. This endows LLMs with aligned preferences and deep reasoning capabilities for diverse tasks. In this survey, we present a comprehensive overview of learning from rewards, from the perspective of reward models and learning strategies across training, inference, and post-inference stages. We further discuss the benchmarks for reward models and the primary applications. Finally we highlight the challenges and future directions.

However, existing approaches typically treat quality scoring and reasoning descriptions as separate tasks with disjoint optimization objectives, leading to a trade-off: models adept at quality reasoning descriptions struggle with precise score regression, while score-focused models lack interpretability. This limitation hinders the full potential of MLLMs in visual quality assessment, where accuracy and interpretability should be mutually reinforcing. To address this, we propose a unified two-stage training framework comprising a cold-start stage and a reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning stage. Specifically, in the first stage, we distill high-quality data from a teacher model through expert-designed prompts, initializing reasoning capabilities via cross-entropy loss supervision. In the second stage, we introduce a novel reward with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize scoring accuracy and reasoning consistency. We designate the models derived from these two stages as Q-Ponder-CI and Q-Ponder. Extensive experiments show that Q-Ponder achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on quality score regression benchmarks, delivering up to 6.5% higher SRCC on cross-domain datasets. Furthermore, Q-Ponder significantly outperforms description-based SOTA models, including its teacher model Qwen-2.5-VL-72B, particularly in description accuracy and reasonableness, demonstrating the generalization potential over diverse tasks.</p></details> |  |

In our work, given some long-form text generated by an LLM, we study uncertainty at both the level of individual claims contained within the output (via calibration) and across the entire output itself (via conformal prediction). Using biography generation as a testbed for this study, we derive a set of (demographic) attributes (e.g., whether some text describes a man or woman) for each generation to form such "subgroups" of data. We find that although canonical methods for both types of uncertainty quantification perform well when measuring across the entire dataset, such guarantees break down when examining particular subgroups. Having established this issue, we invoke group-conditional methods for uncertainty quantification -- multicalibration and multivalid conformal prediction -- and find that across a variety of approaches, additional subgroup information consistently improves calibration and conformal prediction within subgroups (while crucially retaining guarantees across the entire dataset). As the problems of calibration, conformal prediction, and their multi-group counterparts have not been extensively explored in the context of long-form text generation, we consider these results to form a benchmark for this setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated to UAI 2025 camera ready version</p></details> |

However, there are growing concerns that the current LLM watermarking schemes are vulnerable to expert adversaries wishing to reverse-engineer the watermarking mechanisms. Prior work in breaking or stealing LLM watermarks mainly focuses on the distribution-modifying algorithm of Kirchenbauer et al. (2023), which perturbs the logit vector before sampling. In this work, we focus on reverse-engineering the other prominent LLM watermarking scheme, distortion-free watermarking (Kuditipudi et al. 2024), which preserves the underlying token distribution by using a hidden watermarking key sequence. We demonstrate that, even under a more sophisticated watermarking scheme, it is possible to compromise the LLM and carry out a spoofing attack, i.e. generate a large number of (potentially harmful) texts that can be attributed to the original watermarked LLM. Specifically, we propose using adaptive prompting and a sorting-based algorithm to accurately recover the underlying secret key for watermarking the LLM. Our empirical findings on LLAMA-3.1-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct, Gemma-7b, and OPT-125M challenge the current theoretical claims on the robustness and usability of the distortion-free watermarking techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables, earlier version presented at AAAI'25 Workshop on Preventing and Detecting LLM Generated Misinformation</p></details> |

We present a novel green/red list watermarking approach that partitions the token set into ``green'' and ``red'' lists, subtly increasing the generation probability for green tokens. To correct token distribution bias, our method employs maximal coupling, using a uniform coin flip to decide whether to apply bias correction, with the result embedded as a pseudorandom watermark signal. Theoretical analysis confirms this approach's unbiased nature and robust detection capabilities.

| **[Sample Complexity and Representation Ability of Test-time Scaling Paradigms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05295v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time scaling paradigms have significantly advanced the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks. Despite their empirical success, theoretical understanding of the sample efficiency of various test-time strategies -- such as self-consistency, best-of-$n$, and self-correction -- remains limited. In this work, we first establish a separation result between two repeated sampling strategies: self-consistency requires $\Theta(1/\Delta^2)$ samples to produce the correct answer, while best-of-$n$ only needs $\Theta(1/\Delta)$, where $\Delta < 1$ denotes the probability gap between the correct and second most likely answers. Next, we present an expressiveness result for the self-correction approach with verifier feedback: it enables Transformers to simulate online learning over a pool of experts at test time. Therefore, a single Transformer architecture can provably solve multiple tasks without prior knowledge of the specific task associated with a user query, extending the representation theory of Transformers from single-task to multi-task settings. Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical results, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of self-correction methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Precise Zero-Shot Pointwise Ranking with LLMs through Post-Aggregated Global Context Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10859v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements have successfully harnessed the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) for zero-shot document ranking, exploring a variety of prompting strategies. Comparative approaches like pairwise and listwise achieve high effectiveness but are computationally intensive and thus less practical for larger-scale applications. Scoring-based pointwise approaches exhibit superior efficiency by independently and simultaneously generating the relevance scores for each candidate document. However, this independence ignores critical comparative insights between documents, resulting in inconsistent scoring and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we aim to improve the effectiveness of pointwise methods while preserving their efficiency through two key innovations: (1) We propose a novel Global-Consistent Comparative Pointwise Ranking (GCCP) strategy that incorporates global reference comparisons between each candidate and an anchor document to generate contrastive relevance scores. We strategically design the anchor document as a query-focused summary of pseudo-relevant candidates, which serves as an effective reference point by capturing the global context for document comparison. (2) These contrastive relevance scores can be efficiently Post-Aggregated with existing pointwise methods, seamlessly integrating essential Global Context information in a training-free manner (PAGC). Extensive experiments on the TREC DL and BEIR benchmark demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous pointwise methods while maintaining comparable efficiency. Our method also achieves competitive performance against comparative methods that require substantially more computational resources. More analyses further validate the efficacy of our anchor construction strategy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Study on Individual Spatiotemporal Activity Generation Method Using MCP-Enhanced Chain-of-Thought Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10853v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human spatiotemporal behavior simulation is critical for urban planning research, yet traditional rule-based and statistical approaches suffer from high computational costs, limited generalizability, and poor scalability. While large language models (LLMs) show promise as "world simulators," they face challenges in spatiotemporal reasoning including limited spatial cognition, lack of physical constraint understanding, and group homogenization tendencies. This paper introduces a framework integrating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning with Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enhance LLMs' capability in simulating spatiotemporal behaviors that correspond with validation data patterns. The methodology combines human-like progressive reasoning through a five-stage cognitive framework with comprehensive data processing via six specialized MCP tool categories: temporal management, spatial navigation, environmental perception, personal memory, social collaboration, and experience evaluation. Experiments in Shanghai's Lujiazui district validate the framework's effectiveness across 1,000 generated samples. Results demonstrate high similarity with real mobile signaling data, achieving generation quality scores of 7.86 to 8.36 across different base models. Parallel processing experiments show efficiency improvements, with generation times decreasing from 1.30 to 0.17 minutes per sample when scaling from 2 to 12 processes. This work contributes to integrating CoT reasoning with MCP for urban behavior modeling, advancing LLMs applications in urban computing and providing a practical approach for synthetic mobility data generation. The framework offers a foundation for smart city planning, transportation forecasting, and participatory urban design applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphThought: Graph Combinatorial Optimization with Thought Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11607v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph combinatorial optimization (GCO) problems are central to domains like logistics and bioinformatics. While traditional solvers dominate, large language models (LLMs) offer new possibilities for structured reasoning, yet struggle with complex GCO tasks requiring rigorous combinatorial analysis and multi-step deduction, often producing hallucinated steps. We first formalize the Optimal Thoughts Design (OTD) problem, which provides a structured guidance for producing high-quality intermediate reasoning steps. Building on this formulation, we introduce GraphThought, a novel framework that generates effective reasoning sequences through either heuristic-guided forward search or solver-aligned backward reasoning. By fine-tuning LLMs on these structured thought sequences, we develop Llama-GT, an 8B-parameter model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the GraphArena benchmark, outperforming significantly larger models like DeepSeek-V3. Our results demonstrate that when scaffolded with structured reasoning priors, principled thought generation can significantly enhance LLM performance on GCO tasks without requiring increased model scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 5 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |
| **[Accelerating Diffusion Large Language Models with SlowFast: The Three Golden Principles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10848v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional autoregressive LLMs by enabling parallel token generation and significantly reducing inference latency. However, existing sampling strategies for dLLMs, such as confidence-based or semi-autoregressive decoding, often suffer from static behavior, leading to suboptimal efficiency and limited flexibility. In this paper, we propose SlowFast Sampling, a novel dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively alternates between exploratory and accelerated decoding stages. Our method is guided by three golden principles: certainty principle, convergence principle, and positional principle, which govern when and where tokens can be confidently and efficiently decoded. We further integrate our strategy with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation. Extensive experiments across benchmarks and models show that SlowFast Sampling achieves up to 15.63$\times$ speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and up to 34.22$\times$ when combined with caching. Notably, our approach outperforms strong autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput, demonstrating that well-designed sampling can unlock the full potential of dLLMs for fast and high-quality generation.</p></details> | 11 pages; 5 figures; |

We present the first comprehensive benchmark, which we name `Software Engineering Language Understanding' (SELU), for evaluating LLMs on 17 non-code tasks, spanning from identifying whether a requirement is functional or non-functional to estimating the effort and complexity of backlog items. SELU covers classification, regression, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Masked Language Modeling (MLM) targets, with data drawn from diverse sources such as code repositories, issue tracking systems, and developer forums. We fine-tune 22 open-source LLMs, prompt two proprietary alternatives, and train two baselines. Performance is measured using metrics such as F1-macro, SMAPE, F1-micro, and accuracy, and compared via the Bayesian signed-rank test. Our results show that moderate-scale decoder-only models consistently form a top-tier, exhibiting high mean performance and low across-task variance, while domain adaptation via code-focused pre-training might yield only modest improvements. These insights guide model selection for non-code SE workflows and highlight directions for expanding SELU to generative and design-oriented scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Driven Personalized Answer Generation and Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10829v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online learning has experienced rapid growth due to its flexibility and accessibility. Personalization, adapted to the needs of individual learners, is crucial for enhancing the learning experience, particularly in online settings. A key aspect of personalization is providing learners with answers customized to their specific questions. This paper therefore explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate personalized answers to learners' questions, thereby enhancing engagement and reducing the workload on educators. To evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in this context, we conducted a comprehensive study using the StackExchange platform in two distinct areas: language learning and programming. We developed a framework and a dataset for validating automatically generated personalized answers. Subsequently, we generated personalized answers using different strategies, including 0-shot, 1-shot, and few-shot scenarios. The generated answers were evaluated using three methods: 1. BERTScore, 2. LLM evaluation, and 3. human evaluation. Our findings indicated that providing LLMs with examples of desired answers (from the learner or similar learners) can significantly enhance the LLMs' ability to tailor responses to individual learners' needs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the preprint version of a paper accepted at AIED 2025.

The introduction of Segment Anything Model (SAM) set a milestone on segmentation of natural images, inspiring the design of a multitude of architectures for medical image segmentation. In this survey we offer a comprehensive and in-depth investigation on generalist models for medical image segmentation. We start with an introduction on the fundamentals concepts underpinning their development. Then, we provide a taxonomy on the different declinations of SAM in terms of zero-shot, few-shot, fine-tuning, adapters, on the recent SAM 2, on other innovative models trained on images alone, and others trained on both text and images. We thoroughly analyze their performances at the level of both primary research and best-in-literature, followed by a rigorous comparison with the state-of-the-art task-specific models. We emphasize the need to address challenges in terms of compliance with regulatory frameworks, privacy and security laws, budget, and trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI).

| **[ReCUT: Balancing Reasoning Length and Accuracy in LLMs via Stepwise Trails and Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10822v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting have substantially improved the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, these methods often suffer from overthinking, leading to unnecessarily lengthy or redundant reasoning traces. Existing approaches attempt to mitigate this issue through curating multiple reasoning chains for training LLMs, but their effectiveness is often constrained by the quality of the generated data and prone to overfitting. To address the challenge, we propose Reasoning Compression ThroUgh Stepwise Trials (ReCUT), a novel method aimed at balancing the accuracy and length of reasoning trajectory. Specifically, ReCUT employs a stepwise exploration mechanism and a long-short switched sampling strategy, enabling LLMs to incrementally generate diverse reasoning paths. These paths are evaluated and used to construct preference pairs to train two specialized models (Gemini LLMs)-one optimized for reasoning accuracy, the other for shorter reasoning. A final integrated model is obtained by interpolating the parameters of these two models. Experimental results across multiple math reasoning datasets and backbone models demonstrate that ReCUT significantly reduces reasoning lengths by approximately 30-50%, while maintaining or improving reasoning accuracy compared to various baselines. All codes and data will be released via https://github.com/NEUIR/ReCUT.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoDeepResearch: Long Video Understanding With Agentic Tool Using](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10821v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long video understanding (LVU) presents a significant challenge for current multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) due to the task's inherent complexity and context window constraint. It is widely assumed that addressing LVU tasks requires foundation MLLMs with extended context windows, strong visual perception capabilities, and proficient domain expertise. In this work, we challenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic framework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which are readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a problem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and utilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive experiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench. Our results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial improvements over existing MLLM baselines, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and LongVideoBench, respectively. These findings highlight the promise of agentic systems in overcoming key challenges in LVU problems.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and modular agent collaboration, the system spans all major research phases, including literature review, ideation, methodology planning, experimentation, paper writing, peer review response, and dissemination. By addressing issues such as fragmented workflows, uneven methodological expertise, and cognitive overload, the framework offers a systematic and scalable approach to scientific inquiry. Preliminary explorations demonstrate the feasibility and potential of Auto Research as a promising paradigm for self-improving, AI-driven research processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompts to Summaries: Zero-Shot Language-Guided Video Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10807v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The explosive growth of video data intensified the need for flexible user-controllable summarization tools that can operate without domain-specific training data. Existing methods either rely on datasets, limiting generalization, or cannot incorporate user intent expressed in natural language. We introduce Prompts-to-Summaries: the first zero-shot, text-queryable video summarizer that converts off-the-shelf video-language models (VidLMs) captions into user-guided skims via large language models (LLMs) judging, without the use of training data at all, beating all unsupervised and matching supervised methods. Our pipeline (i) segments raw video footage into coherent scenes, (ii) generates rich scene-level descriptions through a memory-efficient, batch-style VidLM prompting scheme that scales to hours-long videos on a single GPU, (iii) leverages an LLM as a judge to assign scene-level importance scores under a carefully crafted prompt, and finally, (iv) propagates those scores to short segments level via two new metrics: consistency (temporal coherency) and uniqueness (novelty), yielding fine-grained frame importance. On SumMe and TVSum, our data-free approach surpasses all prior data-hungry unsupervised methods. It also performs competitively on the Query-Focused Video Summarization (QFVS) benchmark, despite using no training data and the competing methods requiring supervised frame-level importance. To spur further research, we release VidSum-Reason, a new query-driven dataset featuring long-tailed concepts and multi-step reasoning; our framework attains robust F1 scores and serves as the first challenging baseline. Overall, our results demonstrate that pretrained multimodal models, when orchestrated with principled prompting and score propagation, already provide a powerful foundation for universal, text-queryable video summarization.</p></details> |  |

This paper examines activation probes for detecting "high-stakes" interactions -- where the text indicates that the interaction might lead to significant harm -- as a critical, yet underexplored, target for such monitoring. We evaluate several probe architectures trained on synthetic data, and find them to exhibit robust generalization to diverse, out-of-distribution, real-world data. Probes' performance is comparable to that of prompted or finetuned medium-sized LLM monitors, while offering computational savings of six orders-of-magnitude. Our experiments also highlight the potential of building resource-aware hierarchical monitoring systems, where probes serve as an efficient initial filter and flag cases for more expensive downstream analysis. We release our novel synthetic dataset and codebase to encourage further study.</p></details> | 33 pages |

While deploying separate editing systems for each language might seem viable, this approach incurs substantial costs due to the need to manage multiple models. A more efficient solution involves integrating knowledge updates across all languages into a unified model. However, performing sequential edits across languages often leads to destructive parameter interference, significantly degrading multilingual generalization and the accuracy of injected knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose LangEdit, a novel null-space constrained framework designed to precisely isolate language-specific knowledge updates. The core innovation of LangEdit lies in its ability to project parameter updates for each language onto the orthogonal complement of previous updated subspaces. This approach mathematically guarantees update independence while preserving multilingual generalization capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation across three model architectures, six languages, and four downstream tasks, demonstrating that LangEdit effectively mitigates parameter interference and outperforms existing state-of-the-art editing methods. Our results highlight its potential for enabling efficient and accurate multilingual knowledge updates in LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/VRCMF/LangEdit.git.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |

While RL has proven effective in eliciting such breakthroughs in tasks involving mathematics, coding, and vision, it faces significant challenges in multi-scenario games. The diversity of game rules, interaction modes, and environmental complexities often leads to policies that perform well in one scenario but fail to generalize to others. Simply combining multiple scenarios during training introduces additional challenges, such as training instability and poor performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose Divide-Fuse-Conquer, a framework designed to enhance generalization in multi-scenario RL. This approach starts by heuristically grouping games based on characteristics such as rules and difficulties. Specialized models are then trained for each group to excel at games in the group is what we refer to as the divide step. Next, we fuse model parameters from different groups as a new model, and continue training it for multiple groups, until the scenarios in all groups are conquered. Experiments across 18 TextArena games show that Qwen2.5-32B-Align trained with the Divide-Fuse-Conquer strategy reaches a performance level comparable to Claude3.5, achieving 7 wins and 4 draws. We hope our approach can inspire future research on using reinforcement learning to improve the generalization of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 13 figures, and 8 tables</p></details> |

It poses a grave danger to democracy and the minorities it targets, and it requires active actions against it to avoid escalation. This work presents the first-of-its-kind neo-fascist coding scheme for digital discourse in the USA societal context, overseen by political science researchers. Our work bridges the gap between Natural Language Processing (NLP) and political science against this phenomena. Furthermore, to test the coding scheme, we collect a tremendous amount of activity on the internet from notable neo-fascist groups (the forums of Iron March and Stormfront.org), and the guidelines are applied to a subset of the collected posts. Through crowdsourcing, we annotate a total of a thousand posts that are labeled as neo-fascist or non-neo-fascist. With this labeled data set, we fine-tune and test both Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), obtaining the very first classification models for neo-fascist discourse. We find that the prevalence of neo-fascist rhetoric in this kind of forum is ever-present, making them a good target for future research. The societal context is a key consideration for neo-fascist speech when conducting NLP research. Finally, the work against this kind of political movement must be pressed upon and continued for the well-being of a democratic society. Disclaimer: This study focuses on detecting neo-fascist content in text, similar to other hate speech analyses, without labeling individuals or organizations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Federated LoRA in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks with Independent Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23555v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated LoRA has emerged as a promising technique for efficiently fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on distributed devices by reducing the number of trainable parameters. However, existing approaches often inadequately overlook the theoretical and practical implications of system and data heterogeneity, thereby failing to optimize the overall training efficiency, particularly in terms of wall-clock time. In this paper, we propose an adaptive federated LoRA strategy with independent client sampling to minimize the convergence wall-clock time of federated fine-tuning under both computation and communication heterogeneity. We first derive a new convergence bound for federated LoRA with arbitrary and independent client sampling, notably without requiring the stringent bounded gradient assumption. Then, we introduce an adaptive bandwidth allocation scheme that accounts for heterogeneous client resources and system bandwidth constraints. Based on the derived theory, we formulate and solve a non-convex optimization problem to jointly determine the LoRA sketching ratios and sampling probabilities, aiming to minimize wall-clock convergence time. An efficient and low-complexity algorithm is developed to approximate the solution. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces wall-clock training time compared to state-of-the-art methods across various models and datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, Submitted to IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications (JSAC). arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2402.10097</p></details> |

This paper introduces QuantMCP, a novel framework designed to rigorously ground LLMs in financial reality. By leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized and secure tool invocation, QuantMCP enables LLMs to accurately interface with a diverse array of Python-accessible financial data APIs (e.g., Wind, yfinance). Users can interact via natural language to precisely retrieve up-to-date financial data, thereby overcoming LLM's inherent limitations in factual data recall. More critically, once furnished with this verified, structured data, the LLM's analytical capabilities are unlocked, empowering it to perform sophisticated data interpretation, generate insights, and ultimately support more informed financial decision-making processes. QuantMCP provides a robust, extensible, and secure bridge between conversational AI and the complex world of financial data, aiming to enhance both the reliability and the analytical depth of LLM applications in finance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incentivizing Quality Text Generation via Statistical Contracts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11118v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the success of large language models (LLMs) increases demand for machine-generated text, current pay-per-token pricing schemes create a misalignment of incentives known in economics as moral hazard: Text-generating agents have strong incentive to cut costs by preferring a cheaper model over the cutting-edge one, and this can be done "behind the scenes" since the agent performs inference internally. In this work, we approach this issue from an economic perspective, by proposing a pay-for-performance, contract-based framework for incentivizing quality. We study a principal-agent game where the agent generates text using costly inference, and the contract determines the principal's payment for the text according to an automated quality evaluation. Since standard contract theory is inapplicable when internal inference costs are unknown, we introduce cost-robust contracts. As our main theoretical contribution, we characterize optimal cost-robust contracts through a direct correspondence to optimal composite hypothesis tests from statistics, generalizing a result of Saig et al. (NeurIPS'23). We evaluate our framework empirically by deriving contracts for a range of objectives and LLM evaluation benchmarks, and find that cost-robust contracts sacrifice only a marginal increase in objective value compared to their cost-aware counterparts.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |
| **[Position: Theory of Mind Benchmarks are Broken for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19726v4)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Our paper argues that the majority of theory of mind benchmarks are broken because of their inability to directly test how large language models (LLMs) adapt to new partners. This problem stems from the fact that theory of mind benchmarks for LLMs are overwhelmingly inspired by the methods used to test theory of mind in humans and fall victim to a fallacy of attributing human-like qualities to AI agents. We expect that humans will engage in a consistent reasoning process across various questions about a situation, but this is known to not be the case for current LLMs. Most theory of mind benchmarks only measure what we call literal theory of mind: the ability to predict the behavior of others. However, this type of metric is only informative when agents exhibit self-consistent reasoning. Thus, we introduce the concept of functional theory of mind: the ability to adapt to agents in-context following a rational response to their behavior. We find that many open source LLMs are capable of displaying strong literal theory of mind capabilities, but seem to struggle with functional theory of mind -- even with exceedingly simple partner policies. Simply put, strong literal theory of mind performance does not necessarily imply strong functional theory of mind performance or vice versa. Achieving functional theory of mind, particularly over long interaction horizons with a partner, is a significant challenge deserving a prominent role in any meaningful LLM theory of mind evaluation.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

However, how users perceive, evaluate, and critique these AI features remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the overwhelming volume of user feedback. In this work, we present the first comprehensive, large-scale study of user feedback on AI-powered mobile apps, leveraging a curated dataset of 292 AI-driven apps across 14 categories with 894K AI-specific reviews from Google Play. We develop and validate a multi-stage analysis pipeline that begins with a human-labeled benchmark and systematically evaluates large language models (LLMs) and prompting strategies. Each stage, including review classification, aspect-sentiment extraction, and clustering, is validated for accuracy and consistency. Our pipeline enables scalable, high-precision analysis of user feedback, extracting over one million aspect-sentiment pairs clustered into 18 positive and 15 negative user topics. Our analysis reveals that users consistently focus on a narrow set of themes: positive comments emphasize productivity, reliability, and personalized assistance, while negative feedback highlights technical failures (e.g., scanning and recognition), pricing concerns, and limitations in language support. Our pipeline surfaces both satisfaction with one feature and frustration with another within the same review. These fine-grained, co-occurring sentiments are often missed by traditional approaches that treat positive and negative feedback in isolation or rely on coarse-grained analysis. To this end, our approach provides a more faithful reflection of the real-world user experiences with AI-powered apps. Category-aware analysis further uncovers both universal drivers of satisfaction and domain-specific frustrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, the word error rate (WER) of state-of-the-art ASR remains high for named entities. Since named entities are often the most critical keywords, misrecognizing them can affect all downstream applications, especially when the ASR system functions as the front end of a complex system. In this paper, we introduce a large language model (LLM) revision mechanism to revise incorrect named entities in ASR predictions by leveraging the LLM's reasoning ability as well as local context (e.g., lecture notes) containing a set of correct named entities. Finally, we introduce the NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset, containing 45 hours of data from MIT courses for development and testing. On this dataset, our proposed technique achieves up to 30\% relative WER reduction for named entities.</p></details> |  |

We present a fine-grained evaluation of uncertainty estimation methods for clinical multiple-choice question answering, covering ten open-source LLMs (general-purpose, biomedical, and reasoning models) across two datasets, eleven medical specialties, and six question types. We compare standard single-generation and sampling-based methods, and present a case study exploring simple, single-pass estimators based on behavioral signals in reasoning traces. These lightweight methods approach the performance of Semantic Entropy while requiring only one generation. Our results reveal substantial variation across specialties and question types, underscoring the importance of selecting models based on both the nature of the question and model-specific strengths.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Code Collapse: Reasoning Failures in LLMs via Adversarial Prompting in Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06971v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in tasks requiring complex reasoning, such as code generation, mathematical problem solving, and algorithmic synthesis -- especially when aided by reasoning tokens and Chain-of-Thought prompting. Yet, a core question remains: do these models truly reason, or do they merely exploit shallow statistical patterns? In this paper, we introduce Chain-of-Code Collapse, where we systematically investigate the robustness of reasoning LLMs by introducing a suite of semantically faithful yet adversarially structured prompt perturbations. Our evaluation -- spanning 700 perturbed code generations derived from LeetCode-style problems -- applies transformations such as storytelling reframing, irrelevant constraint injection, example reordering, and numeric perturbation. We observe that while certain modifications severely degrade performance (with accuracy drops up to -42.1%), others surprisingly improve model accuracy by up to 35.3%, suggesting sensitivity not only to semantics but also to surface-level prompt dynamics. These findings expose the fragility and unpredictability of current reasoning systems, underscoring the need for more principles approaches to reasoning alignments and prompting robustness. We release our perturbation datasets and evaluation framework to promote further research in trustworthy and resilient LLM reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Tokenizer To Rule Them All: Emergent Language Plasticity via Multilingual Tokenizers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10766v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretraining massively multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) for many languages at once is challenging due to limited model capacity, scarce high-quality data, and compute constraints. Moreover, the lack of language coverage of the tokenizer makes it harder to address the gap for new languages purely at the post-training stage. In this work, we study what relatively cheap interventions early on in training improve "language plasticity", or adaptation capabilities of the model post-training to new languages. We focus on tokenizer design and propose using a universal tokenizer that is trained for more languages than the primary pretraining languages to enable efficient adaptation in expanding language coverage after pretraining. Our systematic experiments across diverse groups of languages and different training strategies show that a universal tokenizer enables significantly higher language adaptation, with up to 20.2% increase in win rates compared to tokenizers specific to pretraining languages. Furthermore, a universal tokenizer also leads to better plasticity towards languages that are completely unseen in the tokenizer and pretraining, by up to 5% win rate gain. We achieve this adaptation to an expanded set of languages with minimal compromise in performance on the majority of languages included in pretraining.</p></details> |  |

However, their proficiency in iteratively optimizing complex solutions through learning from previous feedback remains insufficiently explored. To bridge this gap, we present OPT-BENCH, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents on large-scale search space optimization problems. OPT-BENCH includes 20 real-world machine learning tasks sourced from Kaggle and 10 classical NP problems, offering a diverse and challenging environment for assessing LLM agents on iterative reasoning and solution refinement. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce OPT-Agent, an end-to-end optimization framework that emulates human reasoning when tackling complex problems by generating, validating, and iteratively improving solutions through leveraging historical feedback. Through extensive experiments on 9 state-of-the-art LLMs from 6 model families, we analyze the effects of optimization iterations, temperature settings, and model architectures on solution quality and convergence. Our results demonstrate that incorporating historical context significantly enhances optimization performance across both ML and NP tasks. All datasets, code, and evaluation tools are open-sourced to promote further research in advancing LLM-driven optimization and iterative reasoning.

However, traditional animation workflows present significant usability barriers for non-professionals, with intricate operational procedures severely hindering creative productivity. To address this, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-aided text animation editing system that enables real-time intent tracking and flexible editing. The system introduces an agent-based dual-stream pipeline that integrates context-aware inline suggestions and conversational guidance as well as employs a semantic-animation mapping to facilitate LLM-driven creative intent translation. Besides, the system supports synchronized text-animation previews and parametric adjustments via unified controls to improve editing workflow. A user study evaluates the system, highlighting its ability to help non-professional users complete animation workflows while validating the pipeline. The findings encourage further exploration of integrating LLMs into a comprehensive video creation workflow.</p></details> |  |

Two key bottlenecks remain in this field: generalization to out-of-distribution environments and reliance on fixed discrete action spaces. To address these challenges, we propose Vision-Language Fly (VLFly), a framework tailored for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to execute language-guided flight. Without the requirement for localization or active ranging sensors, VLFly outputs continuous velocity commands purely from egocentric observations captured by an onboard monocular camera. The VLFly integrates three modules: an instruction encoder based on a large language model (LLM) that reformulates high-level language into structured prompts, a goal retriever powered by a vision-language model (VLM) that matches these prompts to goal images via vision-language similarity, and a waypoint planner that generates executable trajectories for real-time UAV control. VLFly is evaluated across diverse simulation environments without additional fine-tuning and consistently outperforms all baselines. Moreover, real-world VLN tasks in indoor and outdoor environments under direct and indirect instructions demonstrate that VLFly achieves robust open-vocabulary goal understanding and generalized navigation capabilities, even in the presence of abstract language input.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this, we aim to connect a formal mathematical framework -- zigzag persistence from topological data analysis -- with practical and easily applicable algorithms. Zigzag persistence is particularly effective for characterizing data as it dynamically transforms across model layers. Within this framework, we introduce topological descriptors that measure how topological features, $p$-dimensional holes, persist and evolve throughout the layers. Unlike methods that assess each layer individually and then aggregate the results, our approach directly tracks the full evolutionary path of these features. This offers a statistical perspective on how prompts are rearranged and their relative positions changed in the representation space, providing insights into the system's operation as an integrated whole. To demonstrate the expressivity and applicability of our framework, we highlight how sensitive these descriptors are to different models and a variety of datasets. As a showcase application to a downstream task, we use zigzag persistence to establish a criterion for layer pruning, achieving results comparable to state-of-the-art methods while preserving the system-level perspective.</p></details> | <details><summary>10+6 ...</summary><p>10+6 pages, 7 figures, 1 table.

While existing APR techniques primarily target imperative programming languages like C and Java, there is a growing need for effective solutions applicable to declarative software specification languages. This paper systematically investigates the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to repair declarative specifications in Alloy, a declarative formal language used for software specification. We designed 12 different repair settings, encompassing single-agent and dual-agent paradigms, utilizing various LLMs. These configurations also incorporate different levels of feedback, including an auto-prompting mechanism for generating prompts autonomously using LLMs. Our study reveals that dual-agent with auto-prompting setup outperforms the other settings, albeit with a marginal increase in the number of iterations and token usage. This dual-agent setup demonstrated superior effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art Alloy APR techniques when evaluated on a comprehensive set of benchmarks. This work is the first to empirically evaluate LLM capabilities to repair declarative specifications, while taking into account recent trending LLM concepts such as LLM-based agents, feedback, auto-prompting, and tools, thus paving the way for future agent-based techniques in software engineering.</p></details> |  |

While expert-curated taxonomies have traditionally addressed this need, the process is time-consuming and expensive. Furthermore, recent automatic taxonomy construction methods either (1) over-rely on a specific corpus, sacrificing generalizability, or (2) depend heavily on the general knowledge of large language models (LLMs) contained within their pre-training datasets, often overlooking the dynamic nature of evolving scientific domains. Additionally, these approaches fail to account for the multi-faceted nature of scientific literature, where a single research paper may contribute to multiple dimensions (e.g., methodology, new tasks, evaluation metrics, benchmarks). To address these gaps, we propose TaxoAdapt, a framework that dynamically adapts an LLM-generated taxonomy to a given corpus across multiple dimensions. TaxoAdapt performs iterative hierarchical classification, expanding both the taxonomy width and depth based on corpus' topical distribution. We demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance across a diverse set of computer science conferences over the years to showcase its ability to structure and capture the evolution of scientific fields. As a multidimensional method, TaxoAdapt generates taxonomies that are 26.51% more granularity-preserving and 50.41% more coherent than the most competitive baselines judged by LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 Main Conference.

There are, however, many links missing in the resource, and in this paper, we look at how we can establish hypernymy between adjectives. We present a theoretical discussion of the hypernymy relation and how it differs for adjectives in contrast to nouns and verbs. We develop a new resource for adjective hypernymy and fine-tune large language models to predict adjective hypernymy, showing that the methodology of TaxoLLaMa can be adapted to this task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incentivizing Reasoning for Advanced Instruction-Following of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01413v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing large language models (LLMs) face challenges of following complex instructions, especially when multiple constraints are present and organized in paralleling, chaining, and branching structures. One intuitive solution, namely chain-of-thought (CoT), is expected to universally improve capabilities of LLMs. However, we find that the vanilla CoT exerts a negative impact on performance due to its superficial reasoning pattern of simply paraphrasing the instructions. It fails to peel back the compositions of constraints for identifying their relationship across hierarchies of types and dimensions. To this end, we propose a systematic method to boost LLMs in dealing with complex instructions via incentivizing reasoning for test-time compute scaling. First, we stem from the decomposition of complex instructions under existing taxonomies and propose a reproducible data acquisition method. Second, we exploit reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rule-centric reward signals to cultivate reasoning specifically for instruction following. We address the shallow, non-essential nature of reasoning under complex instructions via sample-wise contrast for superior CoT enforcement. We also exploit behavior cloning of experts to facilitate steady distribution shift from fast-thinking LLMs to skillful reasoners. Extensive evaluations on seven comprehensive benchmarks confirm the validity of the proposed method, where a 1.5B LLM achieves 11.74% gains with performance comparable to a 8B LLM.

Previously restricted to classification problems on small tables, recent advances such as TabPFN and TabICL have extended its use to larger datasets. While being architecturally efficient and well-adapted to tabular data structures, current table-native ICL architectures, being trained exclusively on synthetic data, do not fully leverage the rich semantics and world knowledge contained in real-world tabular data. On another end of this spectrum, tabular ICL models based on pretrained large language models such as TabuLa-8B integrate deep semantic understanding and world knowledge but are only able to make use of a small amount of context due to inherent architectural limitations. With the aim to combine the best of both these worlds, we introduce ConTextTab, integrating semantic understanding and alignment into a table-native ICL framework. By employing specialized embeddings for different data modalities and by training on large-scale real-world tabular data, our model is competitive with SOTA across a broad set of benchmarks while setting a new standard on the semantically rich CARTE benchmark.</p></details> |  |

One notable application is Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis, where certain biomarkers may influence the presence of others, enabling early detection, precise disease staging, targeted treatments, and improved monitoring of disease progression. However, understanding these causal relationships is complex and requires extensive research. Constructing a comprehensive causal network of biomarkers demands significant effort from human experts, who must analyze a vast number of research papers, and have bias in understanding diseases' biomarkers and their relation. This raises an important question: Can advanced large language models (LLMs), such as those utilizing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), assist in building causal networks of biomarkers for further medical analysis? To explore this, we collected 200 AD-related research papers published over the past 25 years and then integrated scientific literature with RAG to extract AD biomarkers and generate causal relations among them. Given the high-risk nature of the medical diagnosis, we applied uncertainty estimation to assess the reliability of the generated causal edges and examined the faithfulness and scientificness of LLM reasoning using both automatic and human evaluation. We find that RAG enhances the ability of LLMs to generate more accurate causal networks from scientific papers. However, the overall performance of LLMs in identifying causal relations of AD biomarkers is still limited. We hope this study will inspire further foundational research on AI-driven analysis of AD biomarkers causal network discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, under review</p></details> |

Prompts are central to the functionality and performance of LLMs, making them highly valuable assets. The increasing reliance on high-quality prompts has driven significant growth in prompt services. However, this growth also expands the potential for prompt leakage, increasing the risk that attackers could replicate original functionalities, create competing products, and severely infringe on developers' intellectual property. Despite these risks, prompt leakage in real-world prompt services remains underexplored. In this paper, we present PRSA, a practical attack framework designed for prompt stealing. PRSA infers the detailed intent of prompts through very limited input-output analysis and can successfully generate stolen prompts that replicate the original functionality. Extensive evaluations demonstrate PRSA's effectiveness across two main types of real-world prompt services. Specifically, compared to previous works, it improves the attack success rate from 17.8% to 46.1% in prompt marketplaces and from 39% to 52% in LLM application stores, respectively. Notably, in the attack on "Math", one of the most popular educational applications in OpenAI's GPT Store with over 1 million conversations, PRSA uncovered a hidden Easter egg that had not been revealed previously. Besides, our analysis reveals that higher mutual information between a prompt and its output correlates with an increased risk of leakage. This insight guides the design and evaluation of two potential defenses against the security threats posed by PRSA. We have reported these findings to the prompt service vendors, including PromptBase and OpenAI, and actively collaborate with them to implement defensive measures.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the extended version of the paper accepted at the 34th USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 2025)</p></details> |

However, these individual LLMs show limitations in generalization and performance on complex tasks due to inherent training biases, model size constraints, and the quality or diversity of pre-training datasets. A promising direction is to efficiently harness the diverse capabilities of LLMs to overcome these individual limitations. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel LLM selection algorithm called SelectLLM, which efficiently directs input queries to the most suitable subset of LLMs from a large pool, ensuring that the selected models collectively provide accurate responses. SelectLLM employs a multi-label classifier and policy based on the classifier's predictions and confidence scores in selecting an optimal, query-aware, and lightweight subset of LLMs. Our findings indicate that the proposed model outperforms existing ensemble-based baselines and achieves competitive performance with similarly sized top-performing LLMs while maintaining efficiency. Specifically, it achieves a huge reduction in inference latency on two challenging reasoning benchmarks: 13\% on GSM8K and 70\% on MMLU, compared to the top-performing baseline. Also, we establish a theoretical upper bound by an Oracle with LLMs and perform an in-depth linguistic analysis to understand the performance gap between the Oracle and SelectLLM.</p></details> | 9 pages |

This paper presents an effective approach to identifying life-threatening texts using large language models (LLMs) and compares them with traditional methods such as bag of words, word embedding, topic modeling, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. We fine-tune three open-source LLMs including Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2 using their 7B parameter variants on different datasets, which are constructed with class balance, imbalance, and extreme imbalance scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate a strong performance of LLMs against traditional methods. More specifically, Mistral and Llama-2 models are top performers in both balanced and imbalanced data scenarios while Gemma is slightly behind. We employ the upsampling technique to deal with the imbalanced data scenarios and demonstrate that while this method benefits traditional approaches, it does not have as much impact on LLMs. This study demonstrates a great potential of LLMs for real-world life-threatening language detection problems.</p></details> |  |

Bridging the Gap Between Neural Activity and Self-Explanations in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09277v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLM) have demonstrated the capability of generating free text self Natural Language Explanation (self-NLE) to justify their answers. Despite their logical appearance, self-NLE do not necessarily reflect the LLM actual decision-making process, making such explanations unfaithful. While existing methods for measuring self-NLE faithfulness mostly rely on behavioral tests or computational block identification, none of them examines the neural activity underlying the model's reasoning. This work introduces a novel flexible framework for quantitatively measuring the faithfulness of LLM-generated self-NLE by directly comparing the latter with interpretations of the model's internal hidden states. The proposed framework is versatile and provides deep insights into self-NLE faithfulness by establishing a direct connection between self-NLE and model reasoning. This approach advances the understanding of self-NLE faithfulness and provides building blocks for generating more faithful self-NLE.</p></details> |  |

Existing adversarial attack methods often rely on original image characteristics, resulting in distortions that hinder human interpretation and limit applicability in scenarios lacking initial input images. To address these challenges, we propose the Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA (UAC), a novel framework generating high-fidelity adversarial examples guided by attacker-specified text prompts. Leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM), UAC enhances CAPTCHA diversity and supports both targeted and untargeted attacks. For targeted attacks, the EDICT method optimizes dual latent variables in a diffusion model for superior image quality. In untargeted attacks, especially for black-box scenarios, we introduce bi-path unsourced adversarial CAPTCHA (BP-UAC), a two-step optimization strategy employing multimodal gradients and bi-path optimization for efficient misclassification. Experiments show BP-UAC achieves high attack success rates across diverse systems, generating natural CAPTCHAs indistinguishable to humans and DNNs.</p></details> |  |

However, concerns about data contamination - where benchmark data inadvertently leaks into pre-training or fine-tuning datasets - raise questions about the validity of these evaluations. While this issue is known, limiting the industrial adoption of LLM-driven software engineering, hardware coding has received little to no attention regarding these risks. For the first time, we analyze state-of-the-art (SOTA) evaluation frameworks for Verilog code generation (VerilogEval and RTLLM), using established methods for contamination detection (CCD and Min-K% Prob). We cover SOTA commercial and open-source LLMs (CodeGen2.5, Minitron 4b, Mistral 7b, phi-4 mini, LLaMA-{1,2,3.1}, GPT-{2,3.5,4o}, Deepseek-Coder, and CodeQwen 1.5), in baseline and fine-tuned models (RTLCoder and Verigen). Our study confirms that data contamination is a critical concern. We explore mitigations and the resulting trade-offs for code quality vs fairness (i.e., reducing contamination toward unbiased benchmarking).</p></details> |  |

These constraints cannot be validated automatically within AML itself. This work-in-progress paper introduces a pipeline to formalize and verify such constraints. First, AML models are mapped to OWL ontologies via RML and SPARQL. In addition, a Large Language Model translates textual rules into SHACL constraints, which are then validated against the previously generated AML ontology. Finally, SHACL validation results are automatically interpreted in natural language. The approach is demonstrated on a sample AML recommendation. Results show that even complex modeling rules can be semi-automatically checked -- without requiring users to understand formal methods or ontology technologies.</p></details> |  |

Although recent advancements have improved the performance of LLMs in general mathematical reasoning, their effectiveness within specialized domains, such as signal processing, network optimization, and performance analysis, remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce TeleMath, the first benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate LLM performance in solving mathematical problems with numerical solutions in the telecommunications domain. Comprising 500 question-answer (QnA) pairs, TeleMath covers a wide spectrum of topics in the telecommunications field. This paper outlines the proposed QnAs generation pipeline, starting from a selected seed of problems crafted by Subject Matter Experts. The evaluation of a wide range of open-source LLMs reveals that best performance on TeleMath is achieved by recent models explicitly designed for mathematical or logical reasoning. In contrast, general-purpose models, even those with a large number of parameters, often struggle with these challenges. We have released the dataset and the evaluation code to ease result reproducibility and support future research.</p></details> | 6 pages |

Although increasingly capable TSF methods occur, many of them require domain-specific data collection and model training and do not generalize well when applied in other domains. Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) that are pre-trained on massive heterogeneous time series data aim to overcome these limitations. The prospects for generalizability have spurred the development of a new generation of TSFMs. This study proposes a benchmark, TSFM-Bench, to facilitate comprehensive and unified evaluation of TSFMs. TSFM-Bench covers a wide range of TSFMs, including those based on large language models and those pre-trained on time series data. TSFM-Bench supports multiple forecasting scenarios, including zero-shot, few-shot, and full-shot, enabling assessment across the full range of adaptation strategies. TSFM-Bench also provides a standardized experimental protocols for critical evaluation processes such as dataset splitting, loading, normalization, and few-shot sampling, facilitating consistency and fairness. We report on an extensive evaluation of TSFMs across a diverse range of datasets spanning multiple domains and exhibiting varied statistical characteristics. Specifically, we identify pros and cons and inherent limitations of existing TSFMs, and we propose potential directions for new model designs.</p></details> |  |

In the meantime, large language models (LLMs) emerged as promising solutions for many difficult and complex applications/tasks. These lead to a notion of the integration of LLMs and wireless networks. However, this integration is challenging and needs careful attention in design. Therefore, in this article, we present a notion of rational wireless networks powered by \emph{telecom LLMs}, namely, \emph{LLM-native wireless systems}.

In recent studies, transformers are proven to have absolute upper bounds in terms of expressive power, and consequently, they cannot solve many computationally difficult problems. However, empowered by CoT, transformers are proven to be able to solve some difficult problems effectively, such as the $k$-parity problem. Nevertheless, those works rely on two imperative assumptions: (1) identical training and testing distribution, and (2) corruption-free training data with correct reasoning steps. However, in the real world, these assumptions do not always hold. Although the risks of data shifts have caught attention, our work is the first to rigorously study the exact harm caused by such shifts to the best of our knowledge. Focusing on the $k$-parity problem, in this work we investigate the joint impact of two types of data shifts: the distribution shifts and data poisoning, on the quality of trained models obtained by a well-established CoT decomposition. In addition to revealing a surprising phenomenon that CoT leads to worse performance on learning parity than directly generating the prediction, our technical results also give a rigorous and comprehensive explanation of the mechanistic reasons of such impact.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigate how LLMs internally represent and utilize character-level information during the spelling-out process. Our analysis reveals that, although spelling out is a simple task for humans, it is not handled in a straightforward manner by LLMs. Specifically, we show that the embedding layer does not fully encode character-level information, particularly beyond the first character. As a result, LLMs rely on intermediate and higher Transformer layers to reconstruct character-level knowledge, where we observe a distinct "breakthrough" in their spelling behavior. We validate this mechanism through three complementary analyses: probing classifiers, identification of knowledge neurons, and inspection of attention weights.</p></details> |  |

However, the requirements to deploy such a service are often unknown and difficult to evaluate in advance. To facilitate this process, we conducted numerous tests at the Centre Inria de l'Universit\'e de Bordeaux. In this article, we propose a comparison of the performance of several models of different sizes (mainly Mistral and LLaMa) depending on the available GPUs, using vLLM, a Python library designed to optimize the inference of these models. Our results provide valuable information for private and public groups wishing to deploy LLMs, allowing them to evaluate the performance of different models based on their available hardware. This study thus contributes to facilitating the adoption and use of these large language models in various application domains.</p></details> |  |

However, due to their substantial training cost, most academic research uses open-source SAEs which are only available for a restricted set of models of up to 27B parameters. SAE latents are also learned from a dataset of activations, which means they do not transfer between models. Motivated by relative representation similarity measures, we introduce Inference-Time Decomposition of Activations (ITDA) models, an alternative method for decomposing language model activations. To train an ITDA, we greedily construct a dictionary of language model activations on a dataset of prompts, selecting those activations which were worst approximated by matching pursuit on the existing dictionary. ITDAs can be trained in just 1% of the time required for SAEs, using 1% of the data. This allowed us to train ITDAs on Llama-3.1 70B and 405B on a single consumer GPU. ITDAs can achieve similar reconstruction performance to SAEs on some target LLMs, but generally incur a performance penalty. However, ITDA dictionaries enable cross-model comparisons, and a simple Jaccard similarity index on ITDA dictionaries outperforms existing methods like CKA, SVCCA, and relative representation similarity metrics. ITDAs provide a cheap alternative to SAEs where computational resources are limited, or when cross model comparisons are necessary.

Unlike prior Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs) such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which uniformly adjust all token probabilities regardless of their relevance to preference, ConfPO focuses optimization on the most impactful tokens. This targeted approach improves alignment quality while mitigating overoptimization (i.e., reward hacking) by using the KL divergence budget more efficiently. In contrast to recent token-level methods that rely on credit-assignment models or AI annotators, raising concerns about scalability and reliability, ConfPO is simple, lightweight, and model-free. Experimental results on challenging alignment benchmarks, including AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard, demonstrate that ConfPO consistently outperforms uniform DAAs across various LLMs, delivering better alignment with zero additional computational overhead.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

Guardrails--external defense mechanisms that monitor and control LLM interaction--have emerged as a promising solution. However, the current landscape of LLM guardrails is fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy and comprehensive evaluation framework. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper, we present the first holistic analysis of jailbreak guardrails for LLMs. We propose a novel, multi-dimensional taxonomy that categorizes guardrails along six key dimensions, and introduce a Security-Efficiency-Utility evaluation framework to assess their practical effectiveness. Through extensive analysis and experiments, we identify the strengths and limitations of existing guardrail approaches, explore their universality across attack types, and provide insights into optimizing defense combinations. Our work offers a structured foundation for future research and development, aiming to guide the principled advancement and deployment of robust LLM guardrails.

However, effective decision-making remains heavily dependent on the designer's experience, and the absence of mathematical formalization prevents computational support for automated design processes. To bridge this gap, we introduce a structured representation that models design spaces with orthogonal dimensions and discrete selectable elements. Building on this model, we present IDEA, a decision-making framework for augmenting design intelligence through design space exploration to generate effective outcomes. Specifically, IDEA leverages large language models (LLMs) for constraint generation, incorporates a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm guided by these constraints to explore the design space efficiently, and instantiates abstract decisions into domain-specific implementations. We validate IDEA in two design scenarios: data-driven article composition and pictorial visualization generation, supported by example results, expert interviews, and a user study. The evaluation demonstrates the IDEA's adaptability across domains and its capability to produce superior design outcomes.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advances in language technologies, including large language models, evaluating their ability to handle pragmatic phenomena such as implicatures and references remains challenging. To advance pragmatic abilities in models, it is essential to understand current evaluation trends and identify existing limitations. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of resources designed for evaluating pragmatic capabilities in NLP, categorizing datasets by the pragmatic phenomena they address. We analyze task designs, data collection methods, evaluation approaches, and their relevance to real-world applications. By examining these resources in the context of modern language models, we highlight emerging trends, challenges, and gaps in existing benchmarks. Our survey aims to clarify the landscape of pragmatic evaluation and guide the development of more comprehensive and targeted benchmarks, ultimately contributing to more nuanced and context-aware NLP models.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |

Specifically, a number n is included in the sequence if it is prime or ends with a prime number of unit digit or any length. In other words, numbers which are primes or have at least one prime suffix. The resulting sequence exhibits a deterministic yet non-trivial structure, blending number-theoretic properties with symbolic patterning. We propose the Primender sequence as a benchmark for evaluating the symbolic reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The study is motivated by the need for interpretable, rule-based testbeds that can assess an LLM's ability to infer hidden rules, validate mathematical hypotheses, and generalize symbolic logic at scale. A key hypothesis explored is: Whenever a number in the Primender sequence is exactly one more than the largest prime less than or equal to it, the difference between it and the previous number in the sequence is also 1. We design a structured prompt and evaluation framework to test this hypothesis across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Copilot, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, and LLaMA. The models are tasked with identifying the underlying rule, validating the hypothesis, and generating the next 100,000 terms of the sequence. Comparative metrics such as rule inference accuracy, hypothesis evaluation, sequence validity, and symbolic explanation quality are used to assess model performance. This work contributes a novel mathematical construct and a reproducible methodology for benchmarking LLMs in symbolic reasoning, hypothesis testing, and scalable pattern generalization - bridging the domains of number theory, artificial intelligence, and software engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables, 3 codes, oeis sequence A384735</p></details> |

In this work, we demonstrate how word segmentation can be used as a phonological probing task, allowing us to study the representations learned by phoneme-based language models trained on child-directed speech across 31 languages. Following computational models of word segmentation, we present unsupervised methods for extracting word boundaries from a trained model using the observation that prediction-error peaks at the start of words. We also use linear probes to identify that these models implicitly track word boundaries, even when they do not appear in training. This cross-lingual work corroborates statistical learning theories of acquisition and empirically motivates new methods for training subword tokenizers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoNLL 2025</p></details> |

Despite recent progress, significant challenges remain due to the semantic gap between music and dance motion, as music offers only abstract cues, such as melody, groove, and emotion, without explicitly specifying the physical movements. Moreover, a single piece of music can produce multiple plausible dance interpretations. This one-to-many mapping demands additional guidance, as music alone provides limited information for generating diverse dance movements. The challenge is further amplified by the scarcity of paired music and dance data, which restricts the model\^a\u{A}\'Zs ability to learn diverse dance patterns. In this paper, we introduce DanceChat, a Large Language Model (LLM)-guided music-to-dance generation approach. We use an LLM as a choreographer that provides textual motion instructions, offering explicit, high-level guidance for dance generation. This approach goes beyond implicit learning from music alone, enabling the model to generate dance that is both more diverse and better aligned with musical styles. Our approach consists of three components: (1) an LLM-based pseudo instruction generation module that produces textual dance guidance based on music style and structure, (2) a multi-modal feature extraction and fusion module that integrates music, rhythm, and textual guidance into a shared representation, and (3) a diffusion-based motion synthesis module together with a multi-modal alignment loss, which ensures that the generated dance is aligned with both musical and textual cues. Extensive experiments on AIST++ and human evaluations show that DanceChat outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> | <details><summary>check...</summary><p>check demos at https://dancechat.github.io/anon/</p></details> |

Introducing Chain & Hash, An LLM Fingerprinting Technique](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10887v3)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Growing concerns over the theft and misuse of Large Language Models (LLMs) have heightened the need for effective fingerprinting, which links a model to its original version to detect misuse. In this paper, we define five key properties for a successful fingerprint: Transparency, Efficiency, Persistence, Robustness, and Unforgeability. We introduce a novel fingerprinting framework that provides verifiable proof of ownership while maintaining fingerprint integrity. Our approach makes two main contributions. First, we propose a Chain and Hash technique that cryptographically binds fingerprint prompts with their responses, ensuring no adversary can generate colliding fingerprints and allowing model owners to irrefutably demonstrate their creation. Second, we address a realistic threat model in which instruction-tuned models' output distribution can be significantly altered through meta-prompts. By integrating random padding and varied meta-prompt configurations during training, our method preserves fingerprint robustness even when the model's output style is significantly modified. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework offers strong security for proving ownership and remains resilient against benign transformations like fine-tuning, as well as adversarial attempts to erase fingerprints. Finally, we also demonstrate its applicability to fingerprinting LoRA adapters.</p></details> |  |

We propose an end-to-end visual-to-causal framework that transforms a species image into interpretable causal insights about its habitat preference. The system integrates species recognition, global occurrence retrieval, pseudo-absence sampling, and climate data extraction. We then discover causal structures among environmental features and estimate their influence on species occurrence using modern causal inference methods. Finally, we generate statistically grounded, human-readable causal explanations from structured templates and large language models. We demonstrate the framework on a bee and a flower species and report early results as part of an ongoing project, showing the potential of the multimodal AI assistant backed up by a recommended ecological modeling practice for describing species habitat in human-understandable language.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code will be released at: https://github.com/Yutong-Zhou-cv/BioX</p></details> |

However, their lack of a natural language interface remains a significant limitation. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enhanced the understanding of natural language inputs, paving the way for autoformalization - the process of translating natural language proofs into formal proofs that can be verified. Despite these advancements, existing autoformalization approaches are limited to verifying complete proofs and lack the capability for finer, sentence-level verification. To address this gap, we propose StepProof, a novel autoformalization method designed for granular, step-by-step verification. StepProof breaks down complete proofs into multiple verifiable subproofs, enabling sentence-level verification. Experimental results demonstrate that StepProof significantly improves proof success rates and efficiency compared to traditional methods. Additionally, we found that minor manual adjustments to the natural language proofs, tailoring them for step-level verification, further enhanced StepProof's performance in autoformalization.</p></details> |  |

These behaviors are not solely the product of the internal architectures of the underlying models, but emerge from their integration into agentic systems operating within specific contexts, where environmental factors, social cues, and interaction feedbacks shape behavior over time. This evolution necessitates a new scientific perspective: AI Agent Behavioral Science. Rather than focusing only on internal mechanisms, this perspective emphasizes the systematic observation of behavior, design of interventions to test hypotheses, and theory-guided interpretation of how AI agents act, adapt, and interact over time. We systematize a growing body of research across individual agent, multi-agent, and human-agent interaction settings, and further demonstrate how this perspective informs responsible AI by treating fairness, safety, interpretability, accountability, and privacy as behavioral properties. By unifying recent findings and laying out future directions, we position AI Agent Behavioral Science as a necessary complement to traditional model-centric approaches, providing essential tools for understanding, evaluating, and governing the real-world behavior of increasingly autonomous AI systems.</p></details> |  |

However, LMMs still struggle to achieve accurate image-text alignment, prone to generating text responses contradicting the visual input or failing to follow the text-to-image prompts. Current solutions require external supervision (e.g., human feedback or reward models) and only address unidirectional tasks-either understanding or generation. In this work, based on the observation that understanding and generation are inverse dual tasks, we introduce a self-supervised dual reward mechanism to reinforce the understanding and generation capabilities of LMMs. Specifically, we sample multiple outputs for a given input in one task domain, then reverse the input-output pairs to compute the dual likelihood of the model as self-rewards for optimization. Extensive experimental results on visual understanding and generation benchmarks demonstrate that our method can effectively enhance the performance of the model without any external supervision, especially achieving remarkable improvements in text-to-image tasks.</p></details> |  |

By harnessing the advanced reasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge embedded in LLMs, these applications can generate detailed action plans that are subsequently executed by external tools. Furthermore, the integration of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances performance by incorporating up-to-date, domain-specific knowledge into the planning and execution processes. This approach has seen widespread adoption across various sectors, including healthcare, finance, and software development. Meanwhile, there are also growing concerns regarding the security of LLM-based applications. Researchers have disclosed various attacks, represented by jailbreak and prompt injection, to hijack the output actions of these applications. Existing attacks mainly focus on crafting semantically harmful prompts, and their validity could diminish when security filters are employed. In this paper, we introduce AI$\mathbf{^2}$, a novel attack to manipulate the action plans of LLM-based applications. Different from existing solutions, the innovation of AI$\mathbf{^2}$ lies in leveraging the knowledge from the application's database to facilitate the construction of malicious but semantically-harmless prompts. To this end, it first collects action-aware knowledge from the victim application. Based on such knowledge, the attacker can generate misleading input, which can mislead the LLM to generate harmful action plans, while bypassing possible detection mechanisms easily. Our evaluations on three real-world applications demonstrate the effectiveness of AI$\mathbf{^2}$: it achieves an average attack success rate of 84.30\% with the best of 99.70\%. Besides, it gets an average bypass rate of 92.7\% against common safety filters and 59.45\% against dedicated defense.</p></details> |  |

To address these gaps, we introduce Kvasir-VQA-x1, a new, large-scale dataset for gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. Our work significantly expands upon the original Kvasir-VQA by incorporating 159,549 new question-answer pairs that are designed to test deeper clinical reasoning. We developed a systematic method using large language models to generate these questions, which are stratified by complexity to better assess a model's inference capabilities. To ensure our dataset prepares models for real-world clinical scenarios, we have also introduced a variety of visual augmentations that mimic common imaging artifacts. The dataset is structured to support two main evaluation tracks: one for standard VQA performance and another to test model robustness against these visual perturbations. By providing a more challenging and clinically relevant benchmark, Kvasir-VQA-x1 aims to accelerate the development of more reliable and effective multimodal AI systems for use in clinical settings. The dataset is fully accessible and adheres to FAIR data principles, making it a valuable resource for the wider research community.

However, their effectiveness in medical applications remains limited due to the inherent discrepancies between data and tasks in medical scenarios and those in the general domain. Concretely, existing medical MLLMs face the following critical limitations: (1) limited coverage of medical knowledge beyond imaging, (2) heightened susceptibility to hallucinations due to suboptimal data curation processes, (3) lack of reasoning capabilities tailored for complex medical scenarios. To address these challenges, we first propose a comprehensive data curation procedure that (1) efficiently acquires rich medical knowledge data not only from medical imaging but also from extensive medical texts and general-domain data; and (2) synthesizes accurate medical captions, visual question answering (VQA), and reasoning samples. As a result, we build a multimodal dataset enriched with extensive medical knowledge. Building on the curated data, we introduce our medical-specialized MLLM: Lingshu. Lingshu undergoes multi-stage training to embed medical expertise and enhance its task-solving capabilities progressively. Besides, we preliminarily explore the potential of applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards paradigm to enhance Lingshu's medical reasoning ability. Additionally, we develop MedEvalKit, a unified evaluation framework that consolidates leading multimodal and textual medical benchmarks for standardized, fair, and efficient model assessment. We evaluate the performance of Lingshu on three fundamental medical tasks, multimodal QA, text-based QA, and medical report generation. The results show that Lingshu consistently outperforms the existing open-source multimodal models on most tasks ...</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report, 53 pages, 25 tables, and 16 figures</p></details> |

Leveraging ReasonMed, we systematically investigate best practices for training medical reasoning models and find that combining detailed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with concise answer summaries yields the most effective fine-tuning strategy. Based on this strategy, we train ReasonMed-7B, which sets a new benchmark for sub-10B models, outperforming the prior best by 4.17\% and even exceeding LLaMA3.1-70B on PubMedQA by 4.60\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

MedXpertQA includes 4,460 questions spanning 17 specialties and 11 body systems. It includes two subsets, Text for text evaluation and MM for multimodal evaluation. Notably, MM introduces expert-level exam questions with diverse images and rich clinical information, including patient records and examination results, setting it apart from traditional medical multimodal benchmarks with simple QA pairs generated from image captions. MedXpertQA applies rigorous filtering and augmentation to address the insufficient difficulty of existing benchmarks like MedQA, and incorporates specialty board questions to improve clinical relevance and comprehensiveness. We perform data synthesis to mitigate data leakage risk and conduct multiple rounds of expert reviews to ensure accuracy and reliability. We evaluate 18 leading models on \benchmark. Moreover, medicine is deeply connected to real-world decision-making, providing a rich and representative setting for assessing reasoning abilities beyond mathematics and code. To this end, we develop a reasoning-oriented subset to facilitate the assessment of o1-like models.

This report focused on the development of WiNGPT-3.0, the 32-billion parameter LLMs, engineered with the objective of enhancing its capacity for medical reasoning and exploring its potential for effective integration within healthcare IT infrastructures. The broader aim is to advance towards clinically applicable models. The approach involved a multi-stage training pipeline tailored for general, medical, and clinical reasoning. This pipeline incorporated supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), leveraging curated Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) datasets, auxiliary reward models, and an evidence-based diagnostic chain simulation. WiNGPT-3.0 demonstrated strong performance: specific model variants achieved scores of 66.6 on MedCalc and 87.1 on MedQA-USMLE. Furthermore, targeted training improved performance on a clinical reasoning task from a baseline score of 58.1 to 62.5. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning, even when applied with a limited dataset of only a few thousand examples, can enhance medical reasoning accuracy. Crucially, this demonstration of RL's efficacy with limited data and computation paves the way for more trustworthy and practically deployable LLMs within clinical workflows and health information infrastructures.</p></details> |  |

| **[PersianMedQA: Language-Centric Evaluation of LLMs in the Persian Medical Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00250v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on a wide range of NLP benchmarks, often surpassing human-level accuracy. However, their reliability in high-stakes domains such as medicine, particularly in low-resource languages, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce PersianMedQA, a large-scale, expert-validated dataset of multiple-choice Persian medical questions, designed to evaluate LLMs across both Persian and English. We benchmark over 40 state-of-the-art models, including general-purpose, Persian fine-tuned, and medical LLMs, in zero-shot and chain-of-thought (CoT) settings. Our results show that closed-source general models (e.g., GPT-4.1) consistently outperform all other categories, achieving 83.3% accuracy in Persian and 80.7% in English, while Persian fine-tuned models such as Dorna underperform significantly (e.g., 35.9% in Persian), often struggling with both instruction-following and domain reasoning. We also analyze the impact of translation, showing that while English performance is generally higher, Persian responses are sometimes more accurate due to cultural and clinical contextual cues. Finally, we demonstrate that model size alone is insufficient for robust performance without strong domain or language adaptation. PersianMedQA provides a foundation for evaluating multilingual and culturally grounded medical reasoning in LLMs. The PersianMedQA dataset can be accessed at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/MohammadJRanjbar/PersianMedQA</p></details> |  |

A Close Look at How LLMs Think Across Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02126v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reasoning-enhanced Large Language Models such as OpenAI-o1/3 and DeepSeek-R1 have significantly improved performance on complex tasks. However, the quality and transparency of their internal reasoning processes remain underexplored. This work moves beyond the final-answer accuracy and investigates step-by-step reasoning in the medical and mathematical domains by explicitly decomposing the thinking trajectories into two parts: knowledge and reasoning. Specifically, we introduce a fine-grained evaluation framework that judges: (1) the correctness of knowledge used (measured by Knowledge Index (KI)) and (2) the quality of reasoning (measured by Information Gain (InfoGain)). Using this framework, we study R1-distilled and base Qwen models trained with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and/or reinforcement learning (RL) in the medical and math domains. Three intriguing findings emerge: (1) The general reasoning abilities in R1-distilled models do not transfer effectively to the medical domain through either SFT or RL. (2) SFT raises final-answer accuracy in both domains, but often at the cost of reasoning quality: InfoGain drops by 38.9% on average compared with untrained models; In the medical domain, however, SFT remains crucial because domain knowledge is indispensable. (3) RL enhances medical reasoning by pruning inaccurate or irrelevant knowledge from reasoning paths, thereby improving both reasoning accuracy and knowledge correctness.</p></details> | 17 pages, preprint |

RARE incorporates two innovative actions within the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework: A6, which generates search queries based on the initial problem statement, performs information retrieval using those queries, and augments reasoning with the retrieved data to formulate the final answer; and A7, which leverages information retrieval specifically for generated sub-questions and re-answers these sub-questions with the relevant contextual information. Additionally, a Retrieval-Augmented Factuality Scorer is proposed to replace the original discriminator, prioritizing reasoning paths that meet high standards of factuality. Experimental results with LLaMA 3.1 show that RARE enables open-source LLMs to achieve competitive performance with top open-source models like GPT-4 and GPT-4o. This research establishes RARE as a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains where logical coherence and factual integrity are critical.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of ACL 2025 (main track)</p></details> |

However, existing single-agent models struggle to generalize across diverse medical specialties, limiting their performance. Recent efforts introduce multi-agent collaboration frameworks inspired by clinical workflows, where general practitioners (GPs) and specialists interact in a fixed sequence. Despite improvements, these static pipelines lack flexibility and adaptability in reasoning. To address this, we propose MMedAgent-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, optimized collaboration among medical agents. Specifically, we train two GP agents based on Qwen2.5-VL via RL: the triage doctor learns to assign patients to appropriate specialties, while the attending physician integrates the judgments from multi-specialists and its own knowledge to make final decisions. To address the inconsistency in specialist outputs, we introduce a curriculum learning (CL)-guided RL strategy that progressively teaches the attending physician to balance between imitating specialists and correcting their mistakes. Experiments on five medical VQA benchmarks demonstrate that MMedAgent-RL not only outperforms both open-source and proprietary Med-LVLMs, but also exhibits human-like reasoning patterns. Notably, it achieves an average performance gain of 18.4% over supervised fine-tuning baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, their practical deployment faces critical challenges in resource efficiency, diagnostic accuracy, clinical considerations, and ethical privacy. To address these limitations, we propose Infi-Med, a comprehensive framework for medical MLLMs that introduces three key innovations: (1) a resource-efficient approach through curating and constructing high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets with minimal sample requirements, with a forward-looking design that extends to both pretraining and posttraining phases; (2) enhanced multimodal reasoning capabilities for cross-modal integration and clinical task understanding; and (3) a systematic evaluation system that assesses model performance across medical modalities and task types. Our experiments demonstrate that Infi-Med achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in general medical reasoning while maintaining rapid adaptability to clinical scenarios. The framework establishes a solid foundation for deploying MLLMs in real-world healthcare settings by balancing model effectiveness with operational constraints.</p></details> |  |

The recent emergence of multimodal reasoning models has significantly transformed the landscape of solving complex tasks. Although such models have achieved notable success in mathematics and science, their application to medical domains remains underexplored. In this work, we propose \textit{MedE$^2$}, a two-stage post-training pipeline that elicits and then enhances multimodal reasoning for medical domains. In Stage-I, we fine-tune models using 2,000 text-only data samples containing precisely orchestrated reasoning demonstrations to elicit reasoning behaviors. In Stage-II, we further enhance the model's reasoning capabilities using 1,500 rigorously curated multimodal medical cases, aligning model reasoning outputs with our proposed multimodal medical reasoning preference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of \textit{MedE$^2$} in improving the reasoning performance of medical multimodal models. Notably, models trained with \textit{MedE$^2$} consistently outperform baselines across multiple medical multimodal benchmarks. Additional validation on larger models and under inference-time scaling further confirms the robustness and practical utility of our approach.</p></details> |  |

We present MedRAX, the first versatile AI agent that seamlessly integrates state-of-the-art CXR analysis tools and multimodal large language models into a unified framework. MedRAX dynamically leverages these models to address complex medical queries without requiring additional training. To rigorously evaluate its capabilities, we introduce ChestAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark containing 2,500 complex medical queries across 7 diverse categories.

However, beyond general medical knowledge from open-ended datasets, clinical case-based knowledge is also critical for effective medical reasoning, as it provides context grounded in real-world patient experiences.Motivated by this, we propose Experience Retrieval-Augmentation ExpRAG framework based on Electronic Health Record(EHR), aiming to offer the relevant context from other patients' discharge reports. ExpRAG performs retrieval through a coarse-to-fine process, utilizing an EHR-based report ranker to efficiently identify similar patients, followed by an experience retriever to extract task-relevant content for enhanced medical reasoning.To evaluate ExpRAG, we introduce DischargeQA, a clinical QA dataset with 1,280 discharge-related questions across diagnosis, medication, and instruction tasks. Each problem is generated using EHR data to ensure realistic and challenging scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ExpRAG consistently outperforms a text-based ranker, achieving an average relative improvement of 5.2%, highlighting the importance of case-based knowledge for medical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

This survey provides a comprehensive review of LLM-based agents in medicine, examining their architectures, applications, and challenges. We analyze the key components of medical agent systems, including system profiles, clinical planning mechanisms, medical reasoning frameworks, and external capacity enhancement. The survey covers major application scenarios such as clinical decision support, medical documentation, training simulations, and healthcare service optimization. We discuss evaluation frameworks and metrics used to assess these agents' performance in healthcare settings. While LLM-based agents show promise in enhancing healthcare delivery, several challenges remain, including hallucination management, multimodal integration, implementation barriers, and ethical considerations. The survey concludes by highlighting future research directions, including advances in medical reasoning inspired by recent developments in LLM architectures, integration with physical systems, and improvements in training simulations.

To bridge this gap, we propose DoctorRAG, a RAG framework that emulates doctor-like reasoning by integrating both explicit clinical knowledge and implicit case-based experience. DoctorRAG enhances retrieval precision by first allocating conceptual tags for queries and knowledge sources, together with a hybrid retrieval mechanism from both relevant knowledge and patient. In addition, a Med-TextGrad module using multi-agent textual gradients is integrated to ensure that the final output adheres to the retrieved knowledge and patient query. Comprehensive experiments on multilingual, multitask datasets demonstrate that DoctorRAG significantly outperforms strong baseline RAG models and gains improvements from iterative refinements. Our approach generates more accurate, relevant, and comprehensive responses, taking a step towards more doctor-like medical reasoning systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Improving Medical Reasoning with Curriculum-Aware Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19213v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning with verifiable, rule-based rewards have greatly enhanced the reasoning capabilities and out-of-distribution generalization of VLMs/LLMs, obviating the need for manually crafted reasoning chains. Despite these promising developments in the general domain, their translation to medical imaging remains limited. Current medical reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) methods predominantly focus on close-ended VQA, thereby restricting the model's ability to engage in world knowledge retrieval and flexible task adaptation. More critically, these methods fall short of addressing the critical clinical demand for open-ended, reasoning-intensive decision-making. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{MedCCO}, the first multimodal reinforcement learning framework tailored for medical VQA that unifies close-ended and open-ended data within a curriculum-driven RFT paradigm. Specifically, MedCCO is initially fine-tuned on a diverse set of close-ended medical VQA tasks to establish domain-grounded reasoning capabilities, and is then progressively adapted to open-ended tasks to foster deeper knowledge enhancement and clinical interpretability. We validate MedCCO across eight challenging medical VQA benchmarks, spanning both close-ended and open-ended settings. Experimental results show that MedCCO consistently enhances performance and generalization, achieving a 11.4\% accuracy gain across three in-domain tasks, and a 5.7\% improvement on five out-of-domain benchmarks. These findings highlight the promise of curriculum-guided RL in advancing robust, clinically-relevant reasoning in medical multimodal language models.</p></details> |  |

A 3D Medical Benchmark for Tumor-centric Visual Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18915v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in various 2D visual tasks, yet their readiness for 3D clinical diagnosis remains unclear due to stringent demands for recognition precision, reasoning ability, and domain knowledge. To systematically evaluate these dimensions, we present DeepTumorVQA, a diagnostic visual question answering (VQA) benchmark targeting abdominal tumors in CT scans. It comprises 9,262 CT volumes (3.7M slices) from 17 public datasets, with 395K expert-level questions spanning four categories: Recognition, Measurement, Visual Reasoning, and Medical Reasoning. DeepTumorVQA introduces unique challenges, including small tumor detection and clinical reasoning across 3D anatomy. Benchmarking four advanced VLMs (RadFM, M3D, Merlin, CT-CHAT), we find current models perform adequately on measurement tasks but struggle with lesion recognition and reasoning, and are still not meeting clinical needs. Two key insights emerge: (1) large-scale multimodal pretraining plays a crucial role in DeepTumorVQA testing performance, making RadFM stand out among all VLMs. (2) Our dataset exposes critical differences in VLM components, where proper image preprocessing and design of vision modules significantly affect 3D perception.

However, prompting-based methods often remain shallow and unstable, while fine-tuned medical LLMs suffer from poor generalization under distribution shifts and limited adaptability to unseen clinical scenarios. To address these limitations, we present TAGS, a test-time framework that combines a broadly capable generalist with a domain-specific specialist to offer complementary perspectives without any model fine-tuning or parameter updates. To support this generalist-specialist reasoning process, we introduce two auxiliary modules: a hierarchical retrieval mechanism that provides multi-scale exemplars by selecting examples based on both semantic and rationale-level similarity, and a reliability scorer that evaluates reasoning consistency to guide final answer aggregation. TAGS achieves strong performance across nine MedQA benchmarks, boosting GPT-4o accuracy by 13.8%, DeepSeek-R1 by 16.8%, and improving a vanilla 7B model from 14.1% to 23.9%. These results surpass several fine-tuned medical LLMs, without any parameter updates.

In this work, we present ChestX-Reasoner, a radiology diagnosis MLLM designed to leverage process supervision mined directly from clinical reports, reflecting the step-by-step reasoning followed by radiologists. We construct a large dataset by extracting and refining reasoning chains from routine radiology reports. Our two-stage training framework combines supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning guided by process rewards to better align model reasoning with clinical standards. We introduce RadRBench-CXR, a comprehensive benchmark featuring 59K visual question answering samples with 301K clinically validated reasoning steps, and propose RadRScore, a metric evaluating reasoning factuality, completeness, and effectiveness. ChestX-Reasoner outperforms existing medical and general-domain MLLMs in both diagnostic accuracy and reasoning ability, achieving 16%, 5.9%, and 18% improvements in reasoning ability compared to the best medical MLLM, the best general MLLM, and its base model, respectively, as well as 3.3%, 24%, and 27% improvements in outcome accuracy.

| **[Disentangling Reasoning and Knowledge in Medical Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11462v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) aims to emulate clinicians' diagnostic thinking, but current benchmarks such as MedQA-USMLE, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA often mix reasoning with factual recall. We address this by separating 11 biomedical QA benchmarks into reasoning- and knowledge-focused subsets using a PubMedBERT classifier that reaches 81 percent accuracy, comparable to human performance. Our analysis shows that only 32.8 percent of questions require complex reasoning. We evaluate biomedical models (HuatuoGPT-o1, MedReason, m1) and general-domain models (DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini, Qwen3), finding consistent gaps between knowledge and reasoning performance. For example, m1 scores 60.5 on knowledge but only 47.1 on reasoning. In adversarial tests where models are misled with incorrect initial reasoning, biomedical models degrade sharply, while larger or RL-trained general models show more robustness. To address this, we train BioMed-R1 using fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on reasoning-heavy examples. It achieves the strongest performance among similarly sized models. Further gains may come from incorporating clinical case reports and training with adversarial and backtracking scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient lightweight medical vertical large language model architecture method, systematically solving the lightweight problem of medical large models from three dimensions: knowledge acquisition, model compression, and computational optimization. At the knowledge acquisition level, a knowledge transfer pipeline is designed from the fine-tuned DeepSeek-R1-Distill-70B teacher model to the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B student model, and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technology is adopted to precisely adjust key attention layers. At the model compression level, compression techniques including 4-bit weight quantization are implemented while preserving the core representation ability for medical reasoning. At the computational optimization level, inference optimization techniques such as Flash Attention acceleration and continuous batching are integrated, and a professional prompt template system is constructed to adapt to different types of medical problems. Experimental results on medical question-answering datasets show that the method proposed in this paper maintains professional accuracy while reducing memory consumption by 64.7\% and inference latency by 12.4\%, providing an effective solution for the application of medical large models in resource-constrained environments such as edge computing devices.</p></details> | 14 pages, 1 figures |
| **[Med-R1: Reinforcement Learning for Generalizable Medical Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13939v4)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in natural image reasoning, yet their potential in medical imaging remains underexplored. Medical vision-language tasks demand precise understanding and clinically coherent answers, which are difficult to achieve due to the complexity of medical data and the scarcity of high-quality expert annotations. These challenges limit the effectiveness of conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategies that work well in general domains. To address these challenges, we propose Med-R1, a reinforcement learning (RL)-enhanced vision-language model designed to improve generalization and reliability in medical reasoning. Built on the DeepSeek strategy, Med-R1 adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to encourage reward-guided learning beyond static annotations. We comprehensively evaluate Med-R1 across eight distinct medical imaging modalities. Med-R1 achieves a 29.94% improvement in average accuracy over its base model Qwen2-VL-2B, and even outperforms Qwen2-VL-72B-a model with 36x more parameters. To assess cross-task generalization, we further evaluate Med-R1 on five question types. Med-R1 outperforms Qwen2-VL-2B by 32.06% in question-type generalization, also surpassing Qwen2-VL-72B. We further explore the thinking process in Med-R1, a crucial component for the success of Deepseek-R1. Our results show that omitting intermediate rationales (No-Thinking-Med-R1) not only improves in-domain and cross-domain generalization with less training, but also challenges the assumption that more reasoning always helps. These findings suggest that in medical VQA, it is not reasoning itself, but its quality and domain alignment, that determine effectiveness. Together, these results highlight that RL improves medical reasoning and generalization, enabling efficient and reliable VLMs for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |

However, the medical knowledge required for input is a huge obstacle for general public, which greatly reduces the universality of these methods. Compared with these domain-specialized auxiliary information, general users tend to rely on oral queries that require logical reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a novel medical vision task: Medical Reasoning Segmentation and Detection (MedSD), which aims to comprehend implicit queries about medical images and generate the corresponding segmentation mask and bounding box for the target object. To accomplish this task, we first introduce a Multi-perspective, Logic-driven Medical Reasoning Segmentation and Detection (MLMR-SD) dataset, which encompasses a substantial collection of medical entity targets along with their corresponding reasoning. Furthermore, we propose MediSee, an effective baseline model designed for medical reasoning segmentation and detection. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can effectively address MedSD with implicit colloquial queries and outperform traditional medical referring segmentation methods.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

Existing LLMs often struggle with intricate medical terminology and the need for accurate clinical insights, leading to performance reduction when quantized for resource-constrained deployment. To address these issues, we propose Quantized Medical Tree of Thought (QM-ToT), a path-based reasoning framework. QM-ToT leverages a Tree of Thought (ToT) reasoning approach to decompose complex medical problems into manageable subtasks, coupled with evaluator assessment layers. This framework facilitates substantial performance improvements in INT4-quantized models on the challenging MedQAUSMLE dataset. Specifically, we demonstrate a remarkable accuracy increase from 34% to 50% for the LLaMA2-70b model and from 58.77% to 69.49% for LLaMA-3.1-8b. Besides, we also proposed an effect data distillation method based on ToT. Compared to the traditional distillation method, we achieved an improvement of 86. 27% while using only 3.9% of the data.This work, for the first time, showcases the potential of ToT to significantly enhance performance on complex biomedical tasks, establishing a crucial foundation for future advances in deploying high-performing quantized LLM in resource-limited medical settings.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Unlike mathematical reasoning, medical reasoning demands meticulous, verifiable thought processes to ensure reliability and accuracy. However, there is a notable lack of datasets that provide transparent, step-by-step reasoning to validate and enhance the medical reasoning ability of AI models. To bridge this gap, we introduce MedReason, a large-scale high-quality medical reasoning dataset designed to enable faithful and explainable medical problem-solving in large language models (LLMs). We utilize a structured medical knowledge graph (KG) to convert clinical QA pairs into logical chains of reasoning, or ``thinking paths'', which trace connections from question elements to answers via relevant KG entities. Each path is validated for consistency with clinical logic and evidence-based medicine. Our pipeline generates detailed reasoning for various medical questions from 7 medical datasets, resulting in a dataset of 32,682 question-answer pairs, each with detailed, step-by-step explanations. Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning with our dataset consistently boosts medical problem-solving capabilities, achieving significant gains of up to 7.7% for DeepSeek-Ditill-8B. Our top-performing model, MedReason-8B, outperforms the Huatuo-o1-8B, a state-of-the-art medical reasoning model, by up to 4.2% on the clinical benchmark MedBullets.

In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of test-time scaling for medical reasoning and present m1, a simple yet effective approach that increases a model's medical reasoning capability at inference. Our evaluation across diverse medical tasks demonstrates that test-time scaling consistently enhances medical reasoning, enabling lightweight fine-tuned models under 10B parameters to establish new state-of-the-art performance, while our 32B model rivals previous 70B-scale medical LLMs. However, we identify an optimal reasoning token budget of approximately 4K, beyond which performance may degrade due to overthinking. Budget forcing, which extends test-time computation through iterative prompts, helps models double-check answers but does not necessarily improve the overall medical QA performance and, in some cases, even introduces errors into previously correct responses. Our case-by-case analysis identifies insufficient medical knowledge as a key bottleneck that prevents further performance gains through test-time scaling. We find that increasing data scale, improving data quality, and expanding model capacity consistently enhance medical knowledge grounding, enabling continued performance improvements, particularly on challenging medical benchmarks where smaller models reach saturation. These findings underscore fundamental differences between medical and mathematical reasoning in LLMs, highlighting that enriched medical knowledge, other than increased reasoning depth alone, is essential for realizing the benefits of test-time scaling.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages; 7 figures; Data, code, and models: https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/m1</p></details> |

This study assesses DeepSeek R1's medical reasoning against expert patterns using 100 MedQA clinical cases. The model achieved 93% diagnostic accuracy, demonstrating systematic clinical judgment through differential diagnosis, guideline-based treatment selection, and integration of patient-specific factors. However, error analysis of seven incorrect cases revealed persistent limitations: anchoring bias, challenges reconciling conflicting data, insufficient exploration of alternatives, overthinking, knowledge gaps, and premature prioritization of definitive treatment over intermediate care. Crucially, reasoning length correlated with accuracy - shorter responses (<5,000 characters) were more reliable, suggesting extended explanations may signal uncertainty or rationalization of errors. While DeepSeek R1 exhibits foundational clinical reasoning capabilities, recurring flaws highlight critical areas for refinement, including bias mitigation, knowledge updates, and structured reasoning frameworks. These findings underscore LLMs' potential to augment medical decision-making through artificial reasoning but emphasize the need for domain-specific validation, interpretability safeguards, and confidence metrics (e.g., response length thresholds) to ensure reliability in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

This high performance makes it increasingly difficult to meaningfully evaluate and differentiate advanced methods. We present MedAgentsBench, a benchmark that focuses on challenging medical questions requiring multi-step clinical reasoning, diagnosis formulation, and treatment planning-scenarios where current models still struggle despite their strong performance on standard tests. Drawing from seven established medical datasets, our benchmark addresses three key limitations in existing evaluations: (1) the prevalence of straightforward questions where even base models achieve high performance, (2) inconsistent sampling and evaluation protocols across studies, and (3) lack of systematic analysis of the interplay between performance, cost, and inference time. Through experiments with various base models and reasoning methods, we demonstrate that the latest thinking models, DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI o3, exhibit exceptional performance in complex medical reasoning tasks. Additionally, advanced search-based agent methods offer promising performance-to-cost ratios compared to traditional approaches. Our analysis reveals substantial performance gaps between model families on complex questions and identifies optimal model selections for different computational constraints. Our benchmark and evaluation framework are publicly available at https://github.com/gersteinlab/medagents-benchmark.</p></details> |  |

Although Medical Visual Language Models (VLMs) show promise for radiological tasks, most existing VLMs merely produce final answers without revealing the underlying reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce MedVLM-R1, a medical VLM that explicitly generates natural language reasoning to enhance transparency and trustworthiness. Instead of relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which often suffers from overfitting to training distributions and fails to foster genuine reasoning, MedVLM-R1 employs a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the model to discover human-interpretable reasoning paths without using any reasoning references. Despite limited training data (600 visual question answering samples) and model parameters (2B), MedVLM-R1 boosts accuracy from 55.11% to 78.22% across MRI, CT, and X-ray benchmarks, outperforming larger models trained on over a million samples. It also demonstrates robust domain generalization under out-of-distribution tasks. By unifying medical image analysis with explicit reasoning, MedVLM-R1 marks a pivotal step toward trustworthy and interpretable AI in clinical practice.

| **[Towards Conversational AI for Disease Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06074v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in diagnostic dialogue, their capabilities for effective management reasoning - including disease progression, therapeutic response, and safe medication prescription - remain under-explored. We advance the previously demonstrated diagnostic capabilities of the Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE) through a new LLM-based agentic system optimised for clinical management and dialogue, incorporating reasoning over the evolution of disease and multiple patient visit encounters, response to therapy, and professional competence in medication prescription. To ground its reasoning in authoritative clinical knowledge, AMIE leverages Gemini's long-context capabilities, combining in-context retrieval with structured reasoning to align its output with relevant and up-to-date clinical practice guidelines and drug formularies. In a randomized, blinded virtual Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) study, AMIE was compared to 21 primary care physicians (PCPs) across 100 multi-visit case scenarios designed to reflect UK NICE Guidance and BMJ Best Practice guidelines. AMIE was non-inferior to PCPs in management reasoning as assessed by specialist physicians and scored better in both preciseness of treatments and investigations, and in its alignment with and grounding of management plans in clinical guidelines. To benchmark medication reasoning, we developed RxQA, a multiple-choice question benchmark derived from two national drug formularies (US, UK) and validated by board-certified pharmacists. While AMIE and PCPs both benefited from the ability to access external drug information, AMIE outperformed PCPs on higher difficulty questions. While further research would be needed before real-world translation, AMIE's strong performance across evaluations marks a significant step towards conversational AI as a tool in disease management.</p></details> | <details><summary>62 pa...</summary><p>62 pages, 7 figures in main text, 36 figures in appendix</p></details> |

Despite showing promise on multiple-choice tests, LLMs frequently struggle with open-ended medical questions, producing responses with dangerous hallucinations or lacking comprehensive coverage of critical aspects. Existing approaches attempt to address these challenges through domain-specific fine-tuning, but this proves resource-intensive and difficult to scale across models. To improve the comprehensiveness and factuality of medical responses, we propose a novel approach utilizing structured medical reasoning. Our method guides LLMs through an seven-step cognitive process inspired by clinical diagnosis, enabling more accurate and complete answers without additional training. Experiments on the MedLFQA benchmark demonstrate that our approach achieves the highest Factuality Score of 85.8, surpassing fine-tuned models. Notably, this improvement transfers to smaller models, highlighting the method's efficiency and scalability. Our code and datasets are available.</p></details> |  |

While prior work on RLVR has primarily focused on mathematical and coding domains, its applicability to other tasks and domains remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate whether medical reasoning can emerge from RLVR. We introduce Med-RLVR as an initial study of RLVR in the medical domain leveraging medical multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) data as verifiable labels. Our results demonstrate that RLVR is not only effective for math and coding but also extends successfully to medical question answering. Notably, Med-RLVR achieves performance comparable to traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on in-distribution tasks while significantly improving out-of-distribution generalization, with an 8-point accuracy gain. Further analysis of training dynamics reveals that, with no explicit reasoning supervision, reasoning emerges from the 3B-parameter base model. These findings underscore the potential of RLVR in domains beyond math and coding, opening new avenues for its application in knowledge-intensive fields such as medicine.</p></details> |  |

However, their deployment in healthcare, especially in disease reasoning tasks, is hindered by the challenge of acquiring expert-level cognitive data. In this paper, we introduce Citrus, a medical language model that bridges the gap between clinical expertise and AI reasoning by emulating the cognitive processes of medical experts. The model is trained on a large corpus of simulated expert disease reasoning data, synthesized using a novel approach that accurately captures the decision-making pathways of clinicians. This approach enables Citrus to better simulate the complex reasoning processes involved in diagnosing and treating medical conditions. To further address the lack of publicly available datasets for medical reasoning tasks, we release the last-stage training data, including a custom-built medical diagnostic dialogue dataset. This open-source contribution aims to support further research and development in the field. Evaluations using authoritative benchmarks such as MedQA, covering tasks in medical reasoning and language understanding, show that Citrus achieves superior performance compared to other models of similar size. These results highlight Citrus potential to significantly enhance medical decision support systems, providing a more accurate and efficient tool for clinical decision-making.</p></details> |  |

However, prior models that rely on pre-training or supervised fine-tuning often exhibit low data efficiency and limited practicality in real-world clinical applications. While OpenAI's o1 highlights test-time scaling in mathematics, attempts to replicate this approach in medicine typically distill responses from GPT-series models to open-source models, focusing primarily on multiple-choice tasks. This strategy, though straightforward, neglects critical concerns like data privacy and realistic deployment in clinical settings. In this work, we present a deployable, small-scale medical reasoning system, MedS3, designed for long-chain reasoning in clinical tasks using a self-evolution paradigm. Starting with a seed dataset of around 8,000 instances spanning five domains and 16 datasets, we prompt a base policy model to perform Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to construct rule-verifiable reasoning chains. Each reasoning step is assigned an evolution rollout value, allowing verified trajectories to train the policy model and the process reward model (PRM). During inference, the policy model generates multiple responses, and the reward model selects the one with a newly proposed PRM-guided Vote-Sum (P-VS) strategy. Experiments on eleven evaluation datasets demonstrate that MedS3 outperforms not only the prior strongest medical model by 6.59, but also 32B-level general reasoning models by 8.71 points.

However, most existing medical LLMs struggle with the advanced reasoning required for complex clinical scenarios, such as differential diagnosis or personalized treatment suggestions. We proposed FineMedLM-o1, which leverages high-quality synthetic medical data and long-form reasoning data for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), enabling advanced dialogue and deep reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we introduced Test-Time Training (TTT) in the medical domain for the first time, facilitating domain adaptation and ensuring reliable, accurate reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that FineMedLM-o1 achieves a 23% average performance improvement over prior models on key medical benchmarks. Furthermore, the introduction of TTT provides an additional 14% performance boost, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing medical reasoning capabilities. To support this process, we also proposed a novel method for synthesizing medical dialogue. Compared to other open-source datasets, our dataset stands out as superior in both quality and complexity. The project and data will be released on GitHub.</p></details> |  |

However, their limitations in navigating open-ended clinical scenarios have recently been shown, raising concerns about the robustness and generalizability of LLM reasoning across diverse, real-world medical tasks. To probe potential LLM failure modes in clinical problem-solving, we present the medical abstraction and reasoning corpus (M-ARC). M-ARC assesses clinical reasoning through scenarios designed to exploit the Einstellung effect -- the fixation of thought arising from prior experience, targeting LLM inductive biases toward inflexible pattern matching from their training data rather than engaging in flexible reasoning. We find that LLMs, including current state-of-the-art o1 and Gemini models, perform poorly compared to physicians on M-ARC, often demonstrating lack of commonsense medical reasoning and a propensity to hallucinate. In addition, uncertainty estimation analyses indicate that LLMs exhibit overconfidence in their answers, despite their limited accuracy. The failure modes revealed by M-ARC in LLM medical reasoning underscore the need to exercise caution when deploying these models in clinical settings.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

Through extensive experiments on medical benchmarks of varying complexity (MedQA, Medbullets, and JAMA Clinical Challenges), our investigation reveals several key insights: (1) Increasing inference time does lead to improved performance. With a modest training set of 500 samples, our model yields substantial performance improvements of 6%-11%. (2) Task complexity directly correlates with the required length of reasoning chains, confirming the necessity of extended thought processes for challenging problems. (3) The differential diagnoses generated by our model adhere to the principles of the hypothetico-deductive method, producing a list of potential conditions that may explain a patient's symptoms and systematically narrowing these possibilities by evaluating the evidence. These findings demonstrate the promising synergy between inference-time scaling and journey learning in advancing LLMs' real-world clinical reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional vector similarity-based approaches, our system performs medical reasoning at each tree node through a specialized RAG process. Starting from the root node with initial symptoms, the system conducts step-wise medical analysis to identify potential underlying conditions and their corresponding diagnostic requirements. At each level, instead of simple matching, our RAG-enhanced nodes analyze retrieved medical knowledge to understand symptom-disease relationships and determine the most appropriate diagnostic path. The system dynamically adjusts its recommendation strategy based on medical reasoning results, considering factors such as urgency levels and diagnostic uncertainty. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in terms of coverage rate, accuracy, and miss rate compared to conventional retrieval-based methods. This work represents a significant advance in medical test recommendation by introducing medical reasoning capabilities into the traditional tree-based retrieval structure.</p></details> |  |

Yet, most research in reasoning has focused on mathematical tasks, leaving domains like medicine underexplored. The medical domain, though distinct from mathematics, also demands robust reasoning to provide reliable answers, given the high standards of healthcare. However, verifying medical reasoning is challenging, unlike those in mathematics. To address this, we propose verifiable medical problems with a medical verifier to check the correctness of model outputs. This verifiable nature enables advancements in medical reasoning through a two-stage approach: (1) using the verifier to guide the search for a complex reasoning trajectory for fine-tuning LLMs, (2) applying reinforcement learning (RL) with verifier-based rewards to enhance complex reasoning further. Finally, we introduce HuatuoGPT-o1, a medical LLM capable of complex reasoning, which outperforms general and medical-specific baselines using only 40K verifiable problems. Experiments show complex reasoning improves medical problem-solving and benefits more from RL. We hope our approach inspires advancements in reasoning across medical and other specialized domains.</p></details> |  |

LLMs' ability to coalesce vast amounts of information from many sources to generate a response-a process similar to that of a human expert-has led many to see potential in deploying LLMs for clinical use. However, medicine is a setting where accurate reasoning is paramount. Many researchers are questioning the effectiveness of multiple choice question answering (MCQA) benchmarks, frequently used to test LLMs. Researchers and clinicians alike must have complete confidence in LLMs' abilities for them to be deployed in a medical setting. To address this need for understanding, we introduce a knowledge graph (KG)-based method to evaluate the biomedical reasoning abilities of LLMs. Essentially, we map how LLMs link medical concepts in order to better understand how they reason. We test GPT-4, Llama3-70b, and PalmyraMed-70b, a specialized medical model. We enlist a panel of medical students to review a total of 60 LLM-generated graphs and compare these graphs to BIOS, a large biomedical KG. We observe GPT-4 to perform best in our human review but worst in our ground truth comparison; vice-versa with PalmyraMed, the medical model. Our work provides a means of visualizing the medical reasoning pathways of LLMs so they can be implemented in clinical settings safely and effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings paper presented at Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) symposium 2024, December 15-16, 2024, Vancouver, Canada, 19 pages</p></details> |

However, this common approach of task-specific fine-tuning is costly and necessitates separate models for each downstream task, limiting the exploration of zero-shot capabilities. In this paper, we introduce MC-CoT, a modular cross-modal collaboration Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework designed to enhance the zero-shot performance of MLLMs in Med-VQA by leveraging large language models (LLMs). MC-CoT improves reasoning and information extraction by integrating medical knowledge and task-specific guidance, where LLM provides various complex medical reasoning chains and MLLM provides various observations of medical images based on instructions of the LLM. Our experiments on datasets such as SLAKE, VQA-RAD, and PATH-VQA show that MC-CoT surpasses standalone MLLMs and various multimodality CoT frameworks in recall rate and accuracy.

It comprises 33,735 questions derived from real-world medical reports of top-tier tertiary hospitals and authentic examination exercises. The reliability of this benchmark has been confirmed in several ways. Subsequent experiments with existing LLMs have led to the following findings: (i) Chinese medical LLMs underperform on this benchmark, especially where medical reasoning and factual consistency are vital, underscoring the need for advances in clinical knowledge and diagnostic accuracy. (ii) Several general-domain LLMs demonstrate substantial potential in medical clinics, while the limited input capacity of many medical LLMs hinders their practical use.

In this work, we propose MedAdapter, a unified post-hoc adapter for test-time adaptation of LLMs towards biomedical applications. Instead of fine-tuning the entire LLM, MedAdapter effectively adapts the original model by fine-tuning only a small BERT-sized adapter to rank candidate solutions generated by LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that MedAdapter effectively adapts both white-box and black-box LLMs in biomedical reasoning, achieving average performance improvements of 25.48% and 11.31%, respectively, without requiring extensive computational resources or sharing data with third parties. MedAdapter also yields superior performance when combined with train-time adaptation, highlighting a flexible and complementary solution to existing adaptation methods.

In this study, we introduce MedViLaM, a unified vision-language model towards a generalist model for medical data that can flexibly encode and interpret various forms of medical data, including clinical language and imaging, all using the same set of model weights. To facilitate the creation of such multi-task model, we have curated MultiMedBench, a comprehensive pretaining dataset and benchmark consisting of several distinct tasks, i.e., continuous question-answering, multi-label disease classification, disease localization, generation and summarization of radiology reports. MedViLaM demonstrates strong performance across all MultiMedBench tasks, frequently outpacing other generalist models by a significant margin. Additionally, we present instances of zero-shot generalization to new medical concepts and tasks, effective transfer learning across different tasks, and the emergence of zero-shot medical reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompting Large Language Models for Supporting the Differential Diagnosis of Anemia](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15377v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In practice, clinicians achieve a diagnosis by following a sequence of steps, such as laboratory exams, observations, or imaging. The pathways to reach diagnosis decisions are documented by guidelines authored by expert organizations, which guide clinicians to reach a correct diagnosis through these sequences of steps. While these guidelines are beneficial for following medical reasoning and consolidating medical knowledge, they have some drawbacks. They often fail to address patients with uncommon conditions due to their focus on the majority population, and are slow and costly to update, making them unsuitable for rapidly emerging diseases or new practices. Inspired by clinical guidelines, our study aimed to develop pathways similar to those that can be obtained in clinical guidelines. We tested three Large Language Models (LLMs) -Generative Pretrained Transformer 4 (GPT-4), Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), and Mistral -on a synthetic yet realistic dataset to differentially diagnose anemia and its subtypes. By using advanced prompting techniques to enhance the decision-making process, we generated diagnostic pathways using these models. Experimental results indicate that LLMs hold huge potential in clinical pathway discovery from patient data, with GPT-4 exhibiting the best performance in all conducted experiments.</p></details> |  |

While real-world assessments are valuable indicators of utility, they often lag behind the pace of LLM evolution, likely rendering findings obsolete upon deployment. This temporal disconnect necessitates a comprehensive upfront evaluation that can guide model selection for specific clinical applications. We introduce MEDIC, a framework assessing LLMs across five critical dimensions of clinical competence: medical reasoning, ethics and bias, data and language understanding, in-context learning, and clinical safety. MEDIC features a novel cross-examination framework quantifying LLM performance across areas like coverage and hallucination detection, without requiring reference outputs. We apply MEDIC to evaluate LLMs on medical question-answering, safety, summarization, note generation, and other tasks. Our results show performance disparities across model sizes, baseline vs medically finetuned models, and have implications on model selection for applications requiring specific model strengths, such as low hallucination or lower cost of inference. MEDIC's multifaceted evaluation reveals these performance trade-offs, bridging the gap between theoretical capabilities and practical implementation in healthcare settings, ensuring that the most promising models are identified and adapted for diverse healthcare applications.</p></details> | Technical report |

Methods: We used 300 gastroenterology board exam-style multiple-choice questions, 138 of which contain images to systematically assess the impact of model configurations and parameters and prompt engineering strategies utilizing GPT-3.5. Next, we assessed the performance of proprietary and open-source LLMs (versions), including GPT (3.5, 4, 4o, 4omini), Claude (3, 3.5), Gemini (1.0), Mistral, Llama (2, 3, 3.1), Mixtral, and Phi (3), across different interfaces (web and API), computing environments (cloud and local), and model precisions (with and without quantization). Finally, we assessed accuracy using a semiautomated pipeline. Results: Among the proprietary models, GPT-4o (73.7%) and Claude3.5-Sonnet (74.0%) achieved the highest accuracy, outperforming the top open-source models: Llama3.1-405b (64%), Llama3.1-70b (58.3%), and Mixtral-8x7b (54.3%). Among the quantized open-source models, the 6-bit quantized Phi3-14b (48.7%) performed best. The scores of the quantized models were comparable to those of the full-precision models Llama2-7b, Llama2--13b, and Gemma2-9b. Notably, VLM performance on image-containing questions did not improve when the images were provided and worsened when LLM-generated captions were provided. In contrast, a 10% increase in accuracy was observed when images were accompanied by human-crafted image descriptions. Conclusion: In conclusion, while LLMs exhibit robust zero-shot performance in medical reasoning, the integration of visual data remains a challenge for VLMs. Effective deployment involves carefully determining optimal model configurations, encouraging users to consider either the high performance of proprietary models or the flexible adaptability of open-source models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript Pages: 34, Figures: 7, Tables: 2, Supplementary File Pages: 35, Data Transparency Statement: Code is available at: https://github.com/Sdamirsa/LLM-VLM-in-Gastroenterology .

To address challenges that still cannot be handled with the encoded knowledge of LLMs, various retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods have been developed by searching documents from the knowledge corpus and appending them unconditionally or selectively to the input of LLMs for generation. However, when applying existing methods to different domain-specific problems, poor generalization becomes apparent, leading to fetching incorrect documents or making inaccurate judgments. In this paper, we introduce Self-BioRAG, a framework reliable for biomedical text that specializes in generating explanations, retrieving domain-specific documents, and self-reflecting generated responses. We utilize 84k filtered biomedical instruction sets to train Self-BioRAG that can assess its generated explanations with customized reflective tokens. Our work proves that domain-specific components, such as a retriever, domain-related document corpus, and instruction sets are necessary for adhering to domain-related instructions. Using three major medical question-answering benchmark datasets, experimental results of Self-BioRAG demonstrate significant performance gains by achieving a 7.2% absolute improvement on average over the state-of-the-art open-foundation model with a parameter size of 7B or less. Overall, we analyze that Self-BioRAG finds the clues in the question, retrieves relevant documents if needed, and understands how to answer with information from retrieved documents and encoded knowledge as a medical expert does. We release our data and code for training our framework components and model weights (7B and 13B) to enhance capabilities in biomedical and clinical domains.</p></details> | ISMB 2024 |
| **[MedAgents: Large Language Models as Collaborators for Zero-shot Medical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10537v4)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs), despite their remarkable progress across various general domains, encounter significant barriers in medicine and healthcare. This field faces unique challenges such as domain-specific terminologies and reasoning over specialized knowledge. To address these issues, we propose MedAgents, a novel multi-disciplinary collaboration framework for the medical domain. MedAgents leverages LLM-based agents in a role-playing setting that participate in a collaborative multi-round discussion, thereby enhancing LLM proficiency and reasoning capabilities. This training-free framework encompasses five critical steps: gathering domain experts, proposing individual analyses, summarising these analyses into a report, iterating over discussions until a consensus is reached, and ultimately making a decision. Our work focuses on the zero-shot setting, which is applicable in real-world scenarios. Experimental results on nine datasets (MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, and six subtasks from MMLU) establish that our proposed MedAgents framework excels at mining and harnessing the medical expertise within LLMs, as well as extending its reasoning abilities. Our code can be found at https://github.com/gersteinlab/MedAgents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inquire, Interact, and Integrate: A Proactive Agent Collaborative Framework for Zero-Shot Multimodal Medical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11640v1)** | 2024-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The adoption of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare has attracted significant research interest. However, their performance in healthcare remains under-investigated and potentially limited, due to i) they lack rich domain-specific knowledge and medical reasoning skills; and ii) most state-of-the-art LLMs are unimodal, text-only models that cannot directly process multimodal inputs. To this end, we propose a multimodal medical collaborative reasoning framework \textbf{MultiMedRes}, which incorporates a learner agent to proactively gain essential information from domain-specific expert models, to solve medical multimodal reasoning problems. Our method includes three steps: i) \textbf{Inquire}: The learner agent first decomposes given complex medical reasoning problems into multiple domain-specific sub-problems; ii) \textbf{Interact}: The agent then interacts with domain-specific expert models by repeating the ``ask-answer'' process to progressively obtain different domain-specific knowledge; iii) \textbf{Integrate}: The agent finally integrates all the acquired domain-specific knowledge to accurately address the medical reasoning problem. We validate the effectiveness of our method on the task of difference visual question answering for X-ray images. The experiments demonstrate that our zero-shot prediction achieves state-of-the-art performance, and even outperforms the fully supervised methods. Besides, our approach can be incorporated into various LLMs and multimodal LLMs to significantly boost their performance.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior LLM works in healthcare focusing on tasks like question answering, our work specifically focuses on long multi-turn voice conversations. Our one-trillion parameter constellation system is composed of several multibillion parameter LLMs as co-operative agents: a stateful primary agent that focuses on driving an engaging conversation and several specialist support agents focused on healthcare tasks performed by nurses to increase safety and reduce hallucinations. We develop a sophisticated training protocol for iterative co-training of the agents that optimize for diverse objectives. We train our models on proprietary data, clinical care plans, healthcare regulatory documents, medical manuals, and other medical reasoning documents. We align our models to speak like medical professionals, using organic healthcare conversations and simulated ones between patient actors and experienced nurses. This allows our system to express unique capabilities such as rapport building, trust building, empathy and bedside manner. Finally, we present the first comprehensive clinician evaluation of an LLM system for healthcare. We recruited over 1100 U.S. licensed nurses and over 130 U.S. licensed physicians to perform end-to-end conversational evaluations of our system by posing as patients and rating the system on several measures. We demonstrate Polaris performs on par with human nurses on aggregate across dimensions such as medical safety, clinical readiness, conversational quality, and bedside manner. Additionally, we conduct a challenging task-based evaluation of the individual specialist support agents, where we demonstrate our LLM agents significantly outperform a much larger general-purpose LLM (GPT-4) as well as from its own medium-size class (LLaMA-2 70B).</p></details> |  |

For this purpose, we comprehensively evaluated both open-source LLMs and Google's new multimodal LLM called Gemini across Medical reasoning, hallucination detection, and Medical Visual Question Answering tasks. While Gemini showed competence, it lagged behind state-of-the-art models like MedPaLM 2 and GPT-4 in diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, Gemini achieved an accuracy of 61.45\% on the medical VQA dataset, significantly lower than GPT-4V's score of 88\%. Our analysis revealed that Gemini is highly susceptible to hallucinations, overconfidence, and knowledge gaps, which indicate risks if deployed uncritically. We also performed a detailed analysis by medical subject and test type, providing actionable feedback for developers and clinicians. To mitigate risks, we applied prompting strategies that improved performance. Additionally, we facilitated future research and development by releasing a Python module for medical LLM evaluation and establishing a dedicated leaderboard on Hugging Face for medical domain LLMs. Python module can be found at https://github.com/promptslab/RosettaEval</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version, Under Review</p></details> |
| **[From Beginner to Expert: Modeling Medical Knowledge into General LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01040v3)** | 2024-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large language model (LLM) based artificial intelligence (AI) systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. However, these models face a significant challenge when it comes to sensitive applications, such as reasoning over medical knowledge and answering medical questions in a physician-like manner. Prior studies attempted to overcome this challenge by increasing the model size (>100B) to learn more general medical knowledge, while there is still room for improvement in LLMs with smaller-scale model sizes (<100B). In this work, we start from a pre-trained general LLM model (AntGLM-10B) and fine-tune it from a medical beginner towards a medical expert (called AntGLM-Med-10B), which leverages a 3-stage optimization procedure, i.e., general medical knowledge injection, medical domain instruction tuning, and specific medical task adaptation. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We specifically investigate how to adapt a pre-trained general LLM in medical domain, especially for a specific medical task. (2) We collect and construct large-scale medical datasets for each stage of the optimization process. These datasets encompass various data types and tasks, such as question-answering, medical reasoning, multi-choice questions, and medical conversations. (3) Specifically for multi-choice questions in the medical domain, we propose a novel Verification-of-Choice approach for prompting engineering, which significantly enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs. Remarkably, by combining the above approaches, our AntGLM-Med-10B model can outperform the most of LLMs on PubMedQA, including both general and medical LLMs, even when these LLMs have larger model size.</p></details> | <details><summary>Devel...</summary><p>Developed by Ant Group for PubMedQA leaderboard</p></details> |
| **[Towards Generalist Biomedical AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14334v1)** | 2023-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medicine is inherently multimodal, with rich data modalities spanning text, imaging, genomics, and more. Generalist biomedical artificial intelligence (AI) systems that flexibly encode, integrate, and interpret this data at scale can potentially enable impactful applications ranging from scientific discovery to care delivery. To enable the development of these models, we first curate MultiMedBench, a new multimodal biomedical benchmark. MultiMedBench encompasses 14 diverse tasks such as medical question answering, mammography and dermatology image interpretation, radiology report generation and summarization, and genomic variant calling. We then introduce Med-PaLM Multimodal (Med-PaLM M), our proof of concept for a generalist biomedical AI system. Med-PaLM M is a large multimodal generative model that flexibly encodes and interprets biomedical data including clinical language, imaging, and genomics with the same set of model weights. Med-PaLM M reaches performance competitive with or exceeding the state of the art on all MultiMedBench tasks, often surpassing specialist models by a wide margin. We also report examples of zero-shot generalization to novel medical concepts and tasks, positive transfer learning across tasks, and emergent zero-shot medical reasoning. To further probe the capabilities and limitations of Med-PaLM M, we conduct a radiologist evaluation of model-generated (and human) chest X-ray reports and observe encouraging performance across model scales. In a side-by-side ranking on 246 retrospective chest X-rays, clinicians express a pairwise preference for Med-PaLM M reports over those produced by radiologists in up to 40.50% of cases, suggesting potential clinical utility. While considerable work is needed to validate these models in real-world use cases, our results represent a milestone towards the development of generalist biomedical AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by doctors' underlying reasoning process, we present Diagnostic-Reasoning CoT (DR-CoT). Empirical results demonstrate that by simply prompting large language models trained only on general text corpus with two DR-CoT exemplars, the diagnostic accuracy improves by 15% comparing to standard prompting. Moreover, the gap reaches a pronounced 18% in out-domain settings.

| **[Large Language Models Need Holistically Thought in Medical Conversational QA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05410v2)** | 2023-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The medical conversational question answering (CQA) system aims at providing a series of professional medical services to improve the efficiency of medical care. Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in complex reasoning tasks in various fields, such as mathematics, logic, and commonsense QA, they still need to improve with the increased complexity and specialization of the medical field. This is because medical CQA tasks require not only strong medical reasoning, but also the ability to think broadly and deeply. In this paper, to address these challenges in medical CQA tasks that need to be considered and understood in many aspects, we propose the Holistically Thought (HoT) method, which is designed to guide the LLMs to perform the diffused and focused thinking for generating high-quality medical responses. The proposed HoT method has been evaluated through automated and manual assessments in three different medical CQA datasets containing the English and Chinese languages. The extensive experimental results show that our method can produce more correctness, professional, and considerate answers than several state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, manifesting its effectiveness.

| **[Capabilities of GPT-4 on Medical Challenge Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13375v2)** | 2023-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation across various domains, including medicine. We present a comprehensive evaluation of GPT-4, a state-of-the-art LLM, on medical competency examinations and benchmark datasets. GPT-4 is a general-purpose model that is not specialized for medical problems through training or engineered to solve clinical tasks. Our analysis covers two sets of official practice materials for the USMLE, a three-step examination program used to assess clinical competency and grant licensure in the United States. We also evaluate performance on the MultiMedQA suite of benchmark datasets. Beyond measuring model performance, experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of test questions containing both text and images on model performance, probe for memorization of content during training, and study probability calibration, which is of critical importance in high-stakes applications like medicine. Our results show that GPT-4, without any specialized prompt crafting, exceeds the passing score on USMLE by over 20 points and outperforms earlier general-purpose models (GPT-3.5) as well as models specifically fine-tuned on medical knowledge (Med-PaLM, a prompt-tuned version of Flan-PaLM 540B). In addition, GPT-4 is significantly better calibrated than GPT-3.5, demonstrating a much-improved ability to predict the likelihood that its answers are correct. We also explore the behavior of the model qualitatively through a case study that shows the ability of GPT-4 to explain medical reasoning, personalize explanations to students, and interactively craft new counterfactual scenarios around a medical case. Implications of the findings are discussed for potential uses of GPT-4 in medical education, assessment, and clinical practice, with appropriate attention to challenges of accuracy and safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 15 figures; added GPT-4-base model results and discussion</p></details> |

For this, one promising option could be the use of the concepts and ideas of Quantum Mechanics, for the construction of quantum-based Artificial Intelligence systems. From a hybrid classical-quantum perspective, this article deals with the application of quantum computing techniques for the staging of Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the breast. It includes: (1) a general explanation of a classical, and well-established, approach for medical reasoning, (2) a description of the clinical problem, (3) a conceptual model for staging invasive ductal carcinoma, (4) some basic notions about Quantum Rule-Based Systems, (5) a step-by-step explanation of the proposed approach for quantum staging of the invasive ductal carcinoma, and (6) the results obtained after running the quantum system on a significant number of use cases.

| **[Large Language Models Encode Clinical Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13138v1)** | 2022-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, but the quality bar for medical and clinical applications is high. Today, attempts to assess models' clinical knowledge typically rely on automated evaluations on limited benchmarks. There is no standard to evaluate model predictions and reasoning across a breadth of tasks. To address this, we present MultiMedQA, a benchmark combining six existing open question answering datasets spanning professional medical exams, research, and consumer queries; and HealthSearchQA, a new free-response dataset of medical questions searched online. We propose a framework for human evaluation of model answers along multiple axes including factuality, precision, possible harm, and bias. In addition, we evaluate PaLM (a 540-billion parameter LLM) and its instruction-tuned variant, Flan-PaLM, on MultiMedQA. Using a combination of prompting strategies, Flan-PaLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on every MultiMedQA multiple-choice dataset (MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, MMLU clinical topics), including 67.6% accuracy on MedQA (US Medical License Exam questions), surpassing prior state-of-the-art by over 17%. However, human evaluation reveals key gaps in Flan-PaLM responses. To resolve this we introduce instruction prompt tuning, a parameter-efficient approach for aligning LLMs to new domains using a few exemplars. The resulting model, Med-PaLM, performs encouragingly, but remains inferior to clinicians. We show that comprehension, recall of knowledge, and medical reasoning improve with model scale and instruction prompt tuning, suggesting the potential utility of LLMs in medicine. Our human evaluations reveal important limitations of today's models, reinforcing the importance of both evaluation frameworks and method development in creating safe, helpful LLM models for clinical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing Pre-Trained Language Models for Disease Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07285v1)** | 2021-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained language models such as ClinicalBERT have achieved impressive results on tasks such as medical Natural Language Inference. At first glance, this may suggest that these models are able to perform medical reasoning tasks, such as mapping symptoms to diseases. However, we find that standard benchmarks such as MedNLI contain relatively few examples that require such forms of reasoning. To better understand the medical reasoning capabilities of existing language models, in this paper we introduce DisKnE, a new benchmark for Disease Knowledge Evaluation. To construct this benchmark, we annotated each positive MedNLI example with the types of medical reasoning that are needed. We then created negative examples by corrupting these positive examples in an adversarial way. Furthermore, we define training-test splits per disease, ensuring that no knowledge about test diseases can be learned from the training data, and we canonicalize the formulation of the hypotheses to avoid the presence of artefacts. This leads to a number of binary classification problems, one for each type of reasoning and each disease. When analysing pre-trained models for the clinical/biomedical domain on the proposed benchmark, we find that their performance drops considerably.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2021 Findings</p></details> |
| **[Medical idioms for clinical Bayesian network development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00364v2)** | 2020-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian Networks (BNs) are graphical probabilistic models that have proven popular in medical applications. While numerous medical BNs have been published, most are presented fait accompli without explanation of how the network structure was developed or justification of why it represents the correct structure for the given medical application. This means that the process of building medical BNs from experts is typically ad hoc and offers little opportunity for methodological improvement. This paper proposes generally applicable and reusable medical reasoning patterns to aid those developing medical BNs. The proposed method complements and extends the idiom-based approach introduced by Neil, Fenton, and Nielsen in 2000. We propose instances of their generic idioms that are specific to medical BNs. We refer to the proposed medical reasoning patterns as medical idioms. In addition, we extend the use of idioms to represent interventional and counterfactual reasoning. We believe that the proposed medical idioms are logical reasoning patterns that can be combined, reused and applied generically to help develop medical BNs. All proposed medical idioms have been illustrated using medical examples on coronary artery disease. The method has also been applied to other ongoing BNs being developed with medical experts. Finally, we show that applying the proposed medical idioms to published BN models results in models with a clearer structure.</p></details> |  |

It is even more challenging in the presence of preferences such as patient's wishes and clinician's priorities over goals. We advance a structured argumentation formalism for reasoning with conflicting clinical guidelines, patient-specific information and preferences. Our formalism integrates assumption-based reasoning and goal-driven selection among reasoning outcomes. Specifically, we assume applicability of guideline recommendations concerning the generic goal of patient well-being, resolve conflicts among recommendations using patient's conditions and preferences, and then consider prioritised patient-centered goals to yield non-conflicting, goal-maximising and preference-respecting recommendations. We rely on the state-of-the-art Transition-based Medical Recommendation model for representing guideline recommendations and augment it with context given by the patient's conditions, goals, as well as preferences over recommendations and goals. We establish desirable properties of our approach in terms of sensitivity to recommendation conflicts and patient context.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted for publication at AAAMAS 2019</p></details> |
