| **[ML-Agent: Reinforcing LLM Agents for Autonomous Machine Learning Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23723v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of large language model (LLM)-based agents has significantly advanced the development of autonomous machine learning (ML) engineering. However, most existing approaches rely heavily on manual prompt engineering, failing to adapt and optimize based on diverse experimental experiences. Focusing on this, for the first time, we explore the paradigm of learning-based agentic ML, where an LLM agent learns through interactive experimentation on ML tasks using online reinforcement learning (RL). To realize this, we propose a novel agentic ML training framework with three key components: (1) exploration-enriched fine-tuning, which enables LLM agents to generate diverse actions for enhanced RL exploration; (2) step-wise RL, which enables training on a single action step, accelerating experience collection and improving training efficiency; (3) an agentic ML-specific reward module, which unifies varied ML feedback signals into consistent rewards for RL optimization. Leveraging this framework, we train ML-Agent, driven by a 7B-sized Qwen-2.5 LLM for autonomous ML. Remarkably, despite being trained on merely 9 ML tasks, our 7B-sized ML-Agent outperforms the 671B-sized DeepSeek-R1 agent. Furthermore, it achieves continuous performance improvements and demonstrates exceptional cross-task generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-to-Dashboard: Multi-Agent LLM Framework for Insightful Visualization in Enterprise Analytics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23695v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of LLMs has led to the creation of diverse agentic systems in data analysis, utilizing LLMs' capabilities to improve insight generation and visualization. In this paper, we present an agentic system that automates the data-to-dashboard pipeline through modular LLM agents capable of domain detection, concept extraction, multi-perspective analysis generation, and iterative self-reflection. Unlike existing chart QA systems, our framework simulates the analytical reasoning process of business analysts by retrieving domain-relevant knowledge and adapting to diverse datasets without relying on closed ontologies or question templates. We evaluate our system on three datasets across different domains. Benchmarked against GPT-4o with a single-prompt baseline, our approach shows improved insightfulness, domain relevance, and analytical depth, as measured by tailored evaluation metrics and qualitative human assessment. This work contributes a novel modular pipeline to bridge the path from raw data to visualization, and opens new opportunities for human-in-the-loop validation by domain experts in business analytics.

| **[Position: Scaling LLM Agents Requires Asymptotic Analysis with LLM Primitives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04358v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decomposing hard problems into subproblems often makes them easier and more efficient to solve. With large language models (LLMs) crossing critical reliability thresholds for a growing slate of capabilities, there is an increasing effort to decompose systems into sets of LLM-based agents, each of whom can be delegated sub-tasks. However, this decomposition (even when automated) is often intuitive, e.g., based on how a human might assign roles to members of a human team. How close are these role decompositions to optimal? This position paper argues that asymptotic analysis with LLM primitives is needed to reason about the efficiency of such decomposed systems, and that insights from such analysis will unlock opportunities for scaling them. By treating the LLM forward pass as the atomic unit of computational cost, one can separate out the (often opaque) inner workings of a particular LLM from the inherent efficiency of how a set of LLMs are orchestrated to solve hard problems. In other words, if we want to scale the deployment of LLMs to the limit, instead of anthropomorphizing LLMs, asymptotic analysis with LLM primitives should be used to reason about and develop more powerful decompositions of large problems into LLM agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 42nd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2025); 13 pages including references</p></details> |
| **[LifelongAgentBench: Evaluating LLM Agents as Lifelong Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11942v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lifelong learning is essential for intelligent agents operating in dynamic environments. Current large language model (LLM)-based agents, however, remain stateless and unable to accumulate or transfer knowledge over time. Existing benchmarks treat agents as static systems and fail to evaluate lifelong learning capabilities. We present LifelongAgentBench, the first unified benchmark designed to systematically assess the lifelong learning ability of LLM agents. It provides skill-grounded, interdependent tasks across three interactive environments, Database, Operating System, and Knowledge Graph, with automatic label verification, reproducibility, and modular extensibility. Extensive experiments reveal that conventional experience replay has limited effectiveness for LLM agents due to irrelevant information and context length constraints. We further introduce a group self-consistency mechanism that significantly improves lifelong learning performance. We hope LifelongAgentBench will advance the development of adaptive, memory-capable LLM agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[STeCa: Step-level Trajectory Calibration for LLM Agent Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14276v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM)-based agents have shown promise in tackling complex tasks by interacting dynamically with the environment. Existing work primarily focuses on behavior cloning from expert demonstrations or preference learning through exploratory trajectory sampling. However, these methods often struggle to address long-horizon tasks, where suboptimal actions accumulate step by step, causing agents to deviate from correct task trajectories. To address this, we highlight the importance of timely calibration and the need to automatically construct calibration trajectories for training agents. We propose Step-Level Trajectory Calibration (STeCa), a novel framework for LLM agent learning. Specifically, STeCa identifies suboptimal actions through a step-level reward comparison during exploration. It constructs calibrated trajectories using LLM-driven reflection, enabling agents to learn from improved decision-making processes. We finally leverage these calibrated trajectories with successful trajectories for reinforced training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STeCa significantly outperforms existing methods. Further analysis highlights that timely calibration enables agents to complete tasks with greater robustness. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/WangHanLinHenry/STeCa.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL2025 Findings</p></details> |
| **[SafeScientist: Toward Risk-Aware Scientific Discoveries by LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23559v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language model (LLM) agents have significantly accelerated scientific discovery automation, yet concurrently raised critical ethical and safety concerns. To systematically address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{SafeScientist}, an innovative AI scientist framework explicitly designed to enhance safety and ethical responsibility in AI-driven scientific exploration. SafeScientist proactively refuses ethically inappropriate or high-risk tasks and rigorously emphasizes safety throughout the research process. To achieve comprehensive safety oversight, we integrate multiple defensive mechanisms, including prompt monitoring, agent-collaboration monitoring, tool-use monitoring, and an ethical reviewer component. Complementing SafeScientist, we propose \textbf{SciSafetyBench}, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate AI safety in scientific contexts, comprising 240 high-risk scientific tasks across 6 domains, alongside 30 specially designed scientific tools and 120 tool-related risk tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SafeScientist significantly improves safety performance by 35\% compared to traditional AI scientist frameworks, without compromising scientific output quality. Additionally, we rigorously validate the robustness of our safety pipeline against diverse adversarial attack methods, further confirming the effectiveness of our integrated approach. The code and data will be available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/SafeScientist. \textcolor{red}{Warning: this paper contains example data that may be offensive or harmful.}</p></details> |  |
| **[Socratic-PRMBench: Benchmarking Process Reward Models with Systematic Reasoning Patterns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23474v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Process Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial in complex reasoning and problem-solving tasks (e.g., LLM agents with long-horizon decision-making) by verifying the correctness of each intermediate reasoning step. In real-world scenarios, LLMs may apply various reasoning patterns (e.g., decomposition) to solve a problem, potentially suffering from errors under various reasoning patterns. Therefore, PRMs are required to identify errors under various reasoning patterns during the reasoning process. However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on evaluating PRMs with stepwise correctness, ignoring a systematic evaluation of PRMs under various reasoning patterns. To mitigate this gap, we introduce Socratic-PRMBench, a new benchmark to evaluate PRMs systematically under six reasoning patterns, including Transformation, Decomposition, Regather, Deduction, Verification, and Integration. Socratic-PRMBench}comprises 2995 reasoning paths with flaws within the aforementioned six reasoning patterns. Through our experiments on both PRMs and LLMs prompted as critic models, we identify notable deficiencies in existing PRMs. These observations underscore the significant weakness of current PRMs in conducting evaluations on reasoning steps under various reasoning patterns. We hope Socratic-PRMBench can serve as a comprehensive testbed for systematic evaluation of PRMs under diverse reasoning patterns and pave the way for future development of PRMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emergent social conventions and collective bias in LLM populations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08948v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social conventions are the backbone of social coordination, shaping how individuals form a group. As growing populations of artificial intelligence (AI) agents communicate through natural language, a fundamental question is whether they can bootstrap the foundations of a society. Here, we present experimental results that demonstrate the spontaneous emergence of universally adopted social conventions in decentralized populations of large language model (LLM) agents. We then show how strong collective biases can emerge during this process, even when agents exhibit no bias individually. Last, we examine how committed minority groups of adversarial LLM agents can drive social change by imposing alternative social conventions on the larger population. Our results show that AI systems can autonomously develop social conventions without explicit programming and have implications for designing AI systems that align, and remain aligned, with human values and societal goals.</p></details> |  |
| **[GIVE: Structured Reasoning of Large Language Models with Knowledge Graph Inspired Veracity Extrapolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08475v3)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing approaches based on context prompting or reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the reasoning capacities of large language models (LLMs) depend on the LLMs' internal knowledge to produce reliable Chain-Of-Thought (CoT). However, no matter the size of LLMs, certain problems cannot be resolved in a single forward pass. Meanwhile, agent-based reasoning systems require access to a comprehensive nonparametric knowledge base, which is often costly or not feasible for use in scientific and niche domains. We present Graph Inspired Veracity Extrapolation (GIVE), a novel reasoning method that merges parametric and non-parametric memories to improve accurate reasoning with minimal external input. GIVE guides the LLM agent to select the most pertinent expert data (observe), engage in query-specific divergent thinking (reflect), and then synthesize this information to produce the final output (speak). Extensive experiments demonstrated the following benefits of our framework: (1) GIVE boosts the performance of LLMs across various sizes. (2) In some scenarios, GIVE allows smaller LLMs to surpass larger, more sophisticated ones in scientific tasks (GPT3.5T + GIVE > GPT4). (3) GIVE is effective on scientific and open-domain assessments. (4) GIVE is a training-free method that enables LLMs to tackle new problems that extend beyond their training data (up to 43.5% -> 88.2%} accuracy improvement). (5) GIVE allows LLM agents to reason using both restricted (very small) and noisy (very large) knowledge sources, accommodating knowledge graphs (KG) ranging from 135 to more than 840k nodes. (6) The reasoning process involved in GIVE is fully interpretable.</p></details> |  |
| **[GuardAgent: Safeguard LLM Agents by a Guard Agent via Knowledge-Enabled Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09187v3)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large language model (LLM) agents has raised new concerns regarding their safety and security. In this paper, we propose GuardAgent, the first guardrail agent to protect target agents by dynamically checking whether their actions satisfy given safety guard requests. Specifically, GuardAgent first analyzes the safety guard requests to generate a task plan, and then maps this plan into guardrail code for execution. By performing the code execution, GuardAgent can deterministically follow the safety guard request and safeguard target agents. In both steps, an LLM is utilized as the reasoning component, supplemented by in-context demonstrations retrieved from a memory module storing experiences from previous tasks. In addition, we propose two novel benchmarks: EICU-AC benchmark to assess the access control for healthcare agents and Mind2Web-SC benchmark to evaluate the safety policies for web agents. We show that GuardAgent effectively moderates the violation actions for different types of agents on these two benchmarks with over 98% and 83% guardrail accuracies, respectively.

| **[LLM Agents for Bargaining with Utility-based Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22998v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bargaining, a critical aspect of real-world interactions, presents challenges for large language models (LLMs) due to limitations in strategic depth and adaptation to complex human factors. Existing benchmarks often fail to capture this real-world complexity. To address this and enhance LLM capabilities in realistic bargaining, we introduce a comprehensive framework centered on utility-based feedback. Our contributions are threefold: (1) BargainArena, a novel benchmark dataset with six intricate scenarios (e.g., deceptive practices, monopolies) to facilitate diverse strategy modeling; (2) human-aligned, economically-grounded evaluation metrics inspired by utility theory, incorporating agent utility and negotiation power, which implicitly reflect and promote opponent-aware reasoning (OAR); and (3) a structured feedback mechanism enabling LLMs to iteratively refine their bargaining strategies. This mechanism can positively collaborate with in-context learning (ICL) prompts, including those explicitly designed to foster OAR. Experimental results show that LLMs often exhibit negotiation strategies misaligned with human preferences, and that our structured feedback mechanism significantly improves their performance, yielding deeper strategic and opponent-aware reasoning.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Verify-in-the-Graph: Entity Disambiguation Enhancement for Complex Claim Verification with Interactive Graph Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22993v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Claim verification is a long-standing and challenging task that demands not only high accuracy but also explainability of the verification process. This task becomes an emerging research issue in the era of large language models (LLMs) since real-world claims are often complex, featuring intricate semantic structures or obfuscated entities. Traditional approaches typically address this by decomposing claims into sub-claims and querying a knowledge base to resolve hidden or ambiguous entities. However, the absence of effective disambiguation strategies for these entities can compromise the entire verification process. To address these challenges, we propose Verify-in-the-Graph (VeGraph), a novel framework leveraging the reasoning and comprehension abilities of LLM agents. VeGraph operates in three phases: (1) Graph Representation - an input claim is decomposed into structured triplets, forming a graph-based representation that integrates both structured and unstructured information; (2) Entity Disambiguation -VeGraph iteratively interacts with the knowledge base to resolve ambiguous entities within the graph for deeper sub-claim verification; and (3) Verification - remaining triplets are verified to complete the fact-checking process. Experiments using Meta-Llama-3-70B (instruct version) show that VeGraph achieves competitive performance compared to baselines on two benchmarks HoVer and FEVEROUS, effectively addressing claim verification challenges. Our source code and data are available for further exploitation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at NAACL 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[Agent-UniRAG: A Trainable Open-Source LLM Agent Framework for Unified Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22571v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel approach for unified retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems using the recent emerging large language model (LLM) agent concept. Specifically, Agent LLM, which utilizes LLM as fundamental controllers, has become a promising approach to enable the interpretability of RAG tasks, especially for complex reasoning question-answering systems (e.g., multi-hop queries). Nonetheless, previous works mainly focus on solving RAG systems with either single-hop or multi-hop approaches separately, which limits the application of those approaches to real-world applications. In this study, we propose a trainable agent framework called Agent-UniRAG for unified retrieval-augmented LLM systems, which enhances the effectiveness and interpretability of RAG systems. The main idea is to design an LLM agent framework to solve RAG tasks step-by-step based on the complexity of the inputs, simultaneously including single-hop and multi-hop queries in an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, we introduce SynAgent-RAG, a synthetic dataset to enable the proposed agent framework for small open-source LLMs (e.g., Llama-3-8B). The results show comparable performances with closed-source and larger open-source LLMs across various RAG benchmarks. Our source code and dataset are publicly available for further exploitation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Bias Reinforcement in LLM Agents Debate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16814v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models $($LLMs$)$ solve complex problems using training-free methods like prompt engineering and in-context learning, yet ensuring reasoning correctness remains challenging. While self-correction methods such as self-consistency and self-refinement aim to improve reliability, they often reinforce biases due to the lack of effective feedback mechanisms. Multi-Agent Debate $($MAD$)$ has emerged as an alternative, but we identify two key limitations: bias reinforcement, where debate amplifies model biases instead of correcting them, and lack of perspective diversity, as all agents share the same model and reasoning patterns, limiting true debate effectiveness. To systematically evaluate these issues, we introduce $\textit{MetaNIM Arena}$, a benchmark designed to assess LLMs in adversarial strategic decision-making, where dynamic interactions influence optimal decisions. To overcome MAD's limitations, we propose $\textbf{DReaMAD}$ $($$\textbf{D}$iverse $\textbf{Rea}$soning via $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{A}$gent $\textbf{D}$ebate with Refined Prompt$)$, a novel framework that $(1)$ refines LLM's strategic prior knowledge to improve reasoning quality and $(2)$ promotes diverse viewpoints within a single model by systematically modifying prompts, reducing bias. Empirical results show that $\textbf{DReaMAD}$ significantly improves decision accuracy, reasoning diversity, and bias mitigation across multiple strategic tasks, establishing it as a more effective approach for LLM-based decision-making.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

While effective, CaMeL assumes a trusted user prompt, omits side-channel concerns, and incurs performance tradeoffs due to its dual-LLM design. This response identifies these issues and proposes engineering improvements to expand CaMeL's threat coverage and operational usability. We introduce: (1) prompt screening for initial inputs, (2) output auditing to detect instruction leakage, (3) a tiered-risk access model to balance usability and control, and (4) a verified intermediate language for formal guarantees. Together, these upgrades align CaMeL with best practices in enterprise security and support scalable deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[First Steps Towards Overhearing LLM Agents: A Case Study With Dungeons & Dragons Gameplay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22809v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Much work has been done on conversational LLM agents which directly assist human users with tasks. We present an alternative paradigm for interacting with LLM agents, which we call "overhearing agents". These overhearing agents do not actively participate in conversation -- instead, they "listen in" on human-to-human conversations and perform background tasks or provide suggestions to assist the user. In this work, we explore the overhearing agents paradigm through the lens of Dungeons & Dragons gameplay. We present an in-depth study using large multimodal audio-language models as overhearing agents to assist a Dungeon Master. We perform a human evaluation to examine the helpfulness of such agents and find that some large audio-language models have the emergent ability to perform overhearing agent tasks using implicit audio cues. Finally, we release Python libraries and our project code to support further research into the overhearing agents paradigm at https://github.com/zhudotexe/overhearing_agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Position: Uncertainty Quantification Needs Reassessment for Large-language Model Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22655v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-language models (LLMs) and chatbot agents are known to provide wrong outputs at times, and it was recently found that this can never be fully prevented. Hence, uncertainty quantification plays a crucial role, aiming to quantify the level of ambiguity in either one overall number or two numbers for aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. This position paper argues that this traditional dichotomy of uncertainties is too limited for the open and interactive setup that LLM agents operate in when communicating with a user, and that we need to research avenues that enrich uncertainties in this novel scenario. We review the literature and find that popular definitions of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties directly contradict each other and lose their meaning in interactive LLM agent settings. Hence, we propose three novel research directions that focus on uncertainties in such human-computer interactions: Underspecification uncertainties, for when users do not provide all information or define the exact task at the first go, interactive learning, to ask follow-up questions and reduce the uncertainty about the current context, and output uncertainties, to utilize the rich language and speech space to express uncertainties as more than mere numbers. We expect that these new ways of dealing with and communicating uncertainties will lead to LLM agent interactions that are more transparent, trustworthy, and intuitive.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[AgentRecBench: Benchmarking LLM Agent-based Personalized Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19623v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of agentic recommender systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) represents a paradigm shift in personalized recommendations, leveraging LLMs' advanced reasoning and role-playing capabilities to enable autonomous, adaptive decision-making. Unlike traditional recommendation approaches, agentic recommender systems can dynamically gather and interpret user-item interactions from complex environments, generating robust recommendation strategies that generalize across diverse scenarios. However, the field currently lacks standardized evaluation protocols to systematically assess these methods. To address this critical gap, we propose: (1) an interactive textual recommendation simulator incorporating rich user and item metadata and three typical evaluation scenarios (classic, evolving-interest, and cold-start recommendation tasks); (2) a unified modular framework for developing and studying agentic recommender systems; and (3) the first comprehensive benchmark comparing 10 classical and agentic recommendation methods. Our findings demonstrate the superiority of agentic systems and establish actionable design guidelines for their core components. The benchmark environment has been rigorously validated through an open challenge and remains publicly available with a continuously maintained leaderboard~\footnote[2]{https://tsinghua-fib-lab.github.io/AgentSocietyChallenge/pages/overview.html}, fostering ongoing community engagement and reproducible research. The benchmark is available at: \hyperlink{https://huggingface.co/datasets/SGJQovo/AgentRecBench}{https://huggingface.co/datasets/SGJQovo/AgentRecBench}.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |
| **[AgentDNS: A Root Domain Naming System for LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22368v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) agents has highlighted critical challenges in cross-vendor service discovery, interoperability, and communication. Existing protocols like model context protocol and agent-to-agent protocol have made significant strides in standardizing interoperability between agents and tools, as well as communication among multi-agents. However, there remains a lack of standardized protocols and solutions for service discovery across different agent and tool vendors. In this paper, we propose AgentDNS, a root domain naming and service discovery system designed to enable LLM agents to autonomously discover, resolve, and securely invoke third-party agent and tool services across organizational and technological boundaries. Inspired by the principles of the traditional DNS, AgentDNS introduces a structured mechanism for service registration, semantic service discovery, secure invocation, and unified billing. We detail the architecture, core functionalities, and use cases of AgentDNS, demonstrating its potential to streamline multi-agent collaboration in real-world scenarios. The source code will be published on https://github.com/agentdns.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Memento No More: Coaching AI Agents to Master Multiple Tasks via Hints Internalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01562v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the general capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) agents continue to evolve, their ability to learn to master multiple complex tasks through experience remains a key challenge. Current LLM agents, particularly those based on proprietary language models, typically rely on prompts to incorporate knowledge about the target tasks. This approach does not allow the agent to internalize this information and instead relies on ever-expanding prompts to sustain its functionality in diverse scenarios. This resembles a system of notes used by a person affected by anterograde amnesia, the inability to form new memories. In this paper, we propose a novel method to train AI agents to incorporate knowledge and skills for multiple tasks without the need for either cumbersome note systems or prior high-quality demonstration data. Our approach employs an iterative process where the agent collects new experiences, receives corrective feedback from humans in the form of hints, and integrates this feedback into its weights via a context distillation training procedure. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by implementing it in a Llama-3-based agent that, after only a few rounds of feedback, outperforms advanced models GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 in tasksets requiring correct sequencing of information retrieval, tool use, and question answering.</p></details> |  |
| **[PEDANTIC: A Dataset for the Automatic Examination of Definiteness in Patent Claims](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21342v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Patent claims define the scope of protection for an invention. If there are ambiguities in a claim, it is rejected by the patent office. In the US, this is referred to as indefiniteness (35 U.S.C {\S} 112(b)) and is among the most frequent reasons for patent application rejection. The development of automatic methods for patent definiteness examination has the potential to make patent drafting and examination more efficient, but no annotated dataset has been published to date. We introduce PEDANTIC (Patent Definiteness Examination Corpus), a novel dataset of 14k US patent claims from patent applications relating to Natural Language Processing (NLP), annotated with reasons for indefiniteness. We construct PEDANTIC using a fully automatic pipeline that retrieves office action documents from the USPTO and uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract the reasons for indefiniteness. A human validation study confirms the pipeline's accuracy in generating high-quality annotations. To gain insight beyond binary classification metrics, we implement an LLM-as-Judge evaluation that compares the free-form reasoning of every model-cited reason with every examiner-cited reason. We show that LLM agents based on Qwen 2.5 32B and 72B struggle to outperform logistic regression baselines on definiteness prediction, even though they often correctly identify the underlying reasons. PEDANTIC provides a valuable resource for patent AI researchers, enabling the development of advanced examination models. We will publicly release the dataset and code.</p></details> |  |
| **[EPO: Explicit Policy Optimization for Strategic Reasoning in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12486v6)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive reasoning capabilities in well-defined problems with clear solutions, such as mathematics and coding. However, they still struggle with complex real-world scenarios like business negotiations, which require strategic reasoning-an ability to navigate dynamic environments and align long-term goals amidst uncertainty. Existing methods for strategic reasoning face challenges in adaptability, scalability, and transferring strategies to new contexts. To address these issues, we propose explicit policy optimization (EPO) for strategic reasoning, featuring an LLM that provides strategies in open-ended action space and can be plugged into arbitrary LLM agents to motivate goal-directed behavior. To improve adaptability and policy transferability, we train the strategic reasoning model via multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL),utilizing process rewards and iterative self-play. Experiments across social and physical domains demonstrate EPO's ability of long-term goal alignment through enhanced strategic reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on social dialogue and web navigation tasks. Our findings reveal various collaborative reasoning mechanisms emergent in EPO and its effectiveness in generating novel strategies, underscoring its potential for strategic reasoning in real-world applications. Code and data are available at https://github.com/AlibabaResearch/DAMO-ConvAI/tree/main/EPO.</p></details> | ACL2025 main |
| **[The Stepwise Deception: Simulating the Evolution from True News to Fake News with LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19064v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing spread of misinformation online, understanding how true news evolves into fake news has become crucial for early detection and prevention. However, previous research has often assumed fake news inherently exists rather than exploring its gradual formation. To address this gap, we propose FUSE (Fake news evolUtion Simulation framEwork), a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based simulation approach explicitly focusing on fake news evolution from real news. Our framework model a social network with four distinct types of LLM agents commonly observed in daily interactions: spreaders who propagate information, commentators who provide interpretations, verifiers who fact-check, and bystanders who observe passively to simulate realistic daily interactions that progressively distort true news. To quantify these gradual distortions, we develop FUSE-EVAL, a comprehensive evaluation framework measuring truth deviation along multiple linguistic and semantic dimensions. Results show that FUSE effectively captures fake news evolution patterns and accurately reproduces known fake news, aligning closely with human evaluations. Experiments demonstrate that FUSE accurately reproduces known fake news evolution scenarios, aligns closely with human judgment, and highlights the importance of timely intervention at early stages. Our framework is extensible, enabling future research on broader scenarios of fake news.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Trust Collides: Decoding Human-LLM Cooperation Dynamics through the Prisoner's Dilemma](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07320v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly capable of autonomous decision-making, they introduce new challenges and opportunities for human-AI cooperation in mixed-motive contexts. While prior research has primarily examined AI in assistive or cooperative roles, little is known about how humans interact with AI agents perceived as independent and strategic actors. This study investigates human cooperative attitudes and behaviors toward LLM agents by engaging 30 participants (15 males, 15 females) in repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games with agents differing in declared identity: purported human, rule-based AI, and LLM agent. Behavioral metrics, including cooperation rate, decision latency, unsolicited cooperative acts and trust restoration tolerance, were analyzed to assess the influence of agent identity and participant gender. Results revealed significant effects of declared agent identity on most cooperation-related behaviors, along with notable gender differences in decision latency. Furthermore, qualitative responses suggest that these behavioral differences were shaped by participants interpretations and expectations of the agents. These findings contribute to our understanding of human adaptation in competitive cooperation with autonomous agents and underscore the importance of agent framing in shaping effective and ethical human-AI interaction.</p></details> |  |
| **[LaMDAgent: An Autonomous Framework for Post-Training Pipeline Optimization via LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21963v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide range of tasks. To further tailor LLMs to specific domains or applications, post-training techniques such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Preference Learning, and model merging are commonly employed. While each of these methods has been extensively studied in isolation, the automated construction of complete post-training pipelines remains an underexplored area. Existing approaches typically rely on manual design or focus narrowly on optimizing individual components, such as data ordering or merging strategies. In this work, we introduce LaMDAgent (short for Language Model Developing Agent), a novel framework that autonomously constructs and optimizes full post-training pipelines through the use of LLM-based agents. LaMDAgent systematically explores diverse model generation techniques, datasets, and hyperparameter configurations, leveraging task-based feedback to discover high-performing pipelines with minimal human intervention. Our experiments show that LaMDAgent improves tool-use accuracy by 9.0 points while preserving instruction-following capabilities. Moreover, it uncovers effective post-training strategies that are often overlooked by conventional human-driven exploration. We further analyze the impact of data and model size scaling to reduce computational costs on the exploration, finding that model size scalings introduces new challenges, whereas scaling data size enables cost-effective pipeline discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Hypothesis Generation: LLM-Automated Language Bias for Inductive Logic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21486v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automating robust hypothesis generation in open environments is pivotal for AI cognition. We introduce a novel framework integrating a multi-agent system, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), with Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). Our system's LLM agents autonomously define a structured symbolic vocabulary (predicates) and relational templates , i.e., \emph{language bias} directly from raw textual data. This automated symbolic grounding (the construction of the language bias), traditionally an expert-driven bottleneck for ILP, then guides the transformation of text into facts for an ILP solver, which inductively learns interpretable rules. This approach overcomes traditional ILP's reliance on predefined symbolic structures and the noise-sensitivity of pure LLM methods. Extensive experiments in diverse, challenging scenarios validate superior performance, paving a new path for automated, explainable, and verifiable hypothesis generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling External Knowledge Input Beyond Context Windows of LLMs via Multi-Agent Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21471v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of post-training techniques for reasoning and information seeking, large language models (LLMs) can incorporate a large quantity of retrieved knowledge to solve complex tasks. However, the limited context window of LLMs obstructs scaling the amount of external knowledge input, prohibiting further improvement, especially for tasks requiring significant amount of external knowledge. Existing context window extension methods inevitably cause information loss. LLM-based multi-agent methods emerge as a new paradigm to handle massive input in a distributional manner, where we identify two core bottlenecks in existing knowledge synchronization and reasoning processes. In this work, we develop a multi-agent framework, $\textbf{ExtAgents}$, to overcome the bottlenecks and enable better scalability in inference-time knowledge integration without longer-context training. Benchmarked with our enhanced multi-hop question answering test, $\textbf{$\boldsymbol{\infty}$Bench+}$, and other public test sets including long survey generation, ExtAgents significantly enhances the performance over existing non-training methods with the same amount of external knowledge input, regardless of whether it falls $\textit{within or exceeds the context window}$. Moreover, the method maintains high efficiency due to high parallelism. Further study in the coordination of LLM agents on increasing external knowledge input could benefit real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 9 figures.

| **[Autonomous Multi-Modal LLM Agents for Treatment Planning in Focused Ultrasound Ablation Surgery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21418v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Focused Ultrasound Ablation Surgery (FUAS) has emerged as a promising non-invasive therapeutic modality, valued for its safety and precision. Nevertheless, its clinical implementation entails intricate tasks such as multimodal image interpretation, personalized dose planning, and real-time intraoperative decision-making processes that demand intelligent assistance to improve efficiency and reliability. We introduce FUAS-Agents, an autonomous agent system that leverages the multimodal understanding and tool-using capabilities of large language models (LLMs). By integrating patient profiles and MRI data, FUAS-Agents orchestrates a suite of specialized medical AI tools, including segmentation, treatment dose prediction, and clinical guideline retrieval, to generate personalized treatment plans comprising MRI image, dose parameters, and therapeutic strategies. We evaluate the system in a uterine fibroid treatment scenario. Human assessment by four senior FUAS experts indicates that 82.5%, 82.5%, 87.5%, and 97.5% of the generated plans were rated 4 or above (on a 5-point scale) in terms of completeness, accuracy, fluency, and clinical compliance, respectively. These results demonstrate the potential of LLM-driven agents in enhancing decision-making across complex clinical workflows, and exemplify a translational paradigm that combines general-purpose models with specialized expert systems to solve practical challenges in vertical healthcare domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Complex System Diagnostics Using a Knowledge Graph-Informed and Large Language Model-Enhanced Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21291v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a novel diagnostic framework that integrates Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to support system diagnostics in high-reliability systems such as nuclear power plants. Traditional diagnostic modeling struggles when systems become too complex, making functional modeling a more attractive approach. Our approach introduces a diagnostic framework grounded in the functional modeling principles of the Dynamic Master Logic (DML) model. It incorporates two coordinated LLM components, including an LLM-based workflow for automated construction of DML logic from system documentation and an LLM agent that facilitates interactive diagnostics. The generated logic is encoded into a structured KG, referred to as KG-DML, which supports hierarchical fault reasoning. Expert knowledge or operational data can also be incorporated to refine the model's precision and diagnostic depth. In the interaction phase, users submit natural language queries, which are interpreted by the LLM agent. The agent selects appropriate tools for structured reasoning, including upward and downward propagation across the KG-DML. Rather than embedding KG content into every prompt, the LLM agent distinguishes between diagnostic and interpretive tasks. For diagnostics, the agent selects and executes external tools that perform structured KG reasoning. For general queries, a Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph-RAG) approach is used, retrieving relevant KG segments and embedding them into the prompt to generate natural explanations. A case study on an auxiliary feedwater system demonstrated the framework's effectiveness, with over 90% accuracy in key elements and consistent tool and argument extraction, supporting its use in safety-critical diagnostics.</p></details> | 22 Pages, 11 Figures |
| **[Agent-Environment Alignment via Automated Interface Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21055v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents have shown impressive reasoning capabilities in interactive decision-making tasks. These agents interact with environment through intermediate interfaces, such as predefined action spaces and interaction rules, which mediate the perception and action. However, mismatches often happen between the internal expectations of the agent regarding the influence of its issued actions and the actual state transitions in the environment, a phenomenon referred to as \textbf{agent-environment misalignment}. While prior work has invested substantially in improving agent strategies and environment design, the critical role of the interface still remains underexplored. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that agent-environment misalignment poses a significant bottleneck to agent performance. To mitigate this issue, we propose \textbf{ALIGN}, an \underline{A}uto-A\underline{l}igned \underline{I}nterface \underline{G}e\underline{n}eration framework that alleviates the misalignment by enriching the interface. Specifically, the ALIGN-generated interface enhances both the static information of the environment and the step-wise observations returned to the agent. Implemented as a lightweight wrapper, this interface achieves the alignment without modifying either the agent logic or the environment code. Experiments across multiple domains including embodied tasks, web navigation and tool-use, show consistent performance improvements, with up to a 45.67\% success rate improvement observed in ALFWorld. Meanwhile, ALIGN-generated interface can generalize across different agent architectures and LLM backbones without interface regeneration.

PaSa can autonomously make a series of decisions, including invoking search tools, reading papers, and selecting relevant references, to ultimately obtain comprehensive and accurate results for complex scholar queries. We optimize PaSa using reinforcement learning with a synthetic dataset, AutoScholarQuery, which includes 35k fine-grained academic queries and corresponding papers sourced from top-tier AI conference publications. Additionally, we develop RealScholarQuery, a benchmark collecting real-world academic queries to assess PaSa performance in more realistic scenarios. Despite being trained on synthetic data, PaSa significantly outperforms existing baselines on RealScholarQuery, including Google, Google Scholar, Google with GPT-4o for paraphrased queries, ChatGPT (search-enabled GPT-4o), GPT-o1, and PaSa-GPT-4o (PaSa implemented by prompting GPT-4o). Notably, PaSa-7B surpasses the best Google-based baseline, Google with GPT-4o, by 37.78% in recall@20 and 39.90% in recall@50, and exceeds PaSa-GPT-4o by 30.36% in recall and 4.25% in precision.

| **[The Power of Personality: A Human Simulation Perspective to Investigate Large Language Model Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20859v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel in both closed tasks (including problem-solving, and code generation) and open tasks (including creative writing), yet existing explanations for their capabilities lack connections to real-world human intelligence. To fill this gap, this paper systematically investigates LLM intelligence through the lens of ``human simulation'', addressing three core questions: (1) \textit{How do personality traits affect problem-solving in closed tasks?} (2) \textit{How do traits shape creativity in open tasks?} (3) \textit{How does single-agent performance influence multi-agent collaboration?} By assigning Big Five personality traits to LLM agents and evaluating their performance in single- and multi-agent settings, we reveal that specific traits significantly influence reasoning accuracy (closed tasks) and creative output (open tasks). Furthermore, multi-agent systems exhibit collective intelligence distinct from individual capabilities, driven by distinguishing combinations of personalities.</p></details> |  |
| **[MT-Mol:Multi Agent System with Tool-based Reasoning for Molecular Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20820v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have large potential for molecular optimization, as they can gather external chemistry tools and enable collaborative interactions to iteratively refine molecular candidates. However, this potential remains underexplored, particularly in the context of structured reasoning, interpretability, and comprehensive tool-grounded molecular optimization. To address this gap, we introduce MT-Mol, a multi-agent framework for molecular optimization that leverages tool-guided reasoning and role-specialized LLM agents. Our system incorporates comprehensive RDKit tools, categorized into five distinct domains: structural descriptors, electronic and topological features, fragment-based functional groups, molecular representations, and miscellaneous chemical properties. Each category is managed by an expert analyst agent, responsible for extracting task-relevant tools and enabling interpretable, chemically grounded feedback. MT-Mol produces molecules with tool-aligned and stepwise reasoning through the interaction between the analyst agents, a molecule-generating scientist, a reasoning-output verifier, and a reviewer agent. As a result, we show that our framework shows the state-of-the-art performance of the PMO-1K benchmark on 17 out of 23 tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Information Synthesis in Multimodal Question Answering A Multi-Agent Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20816v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal question answering have primarily focused on combining heterogeneous modalities or fine-tuning multimodal large language models. While these approaches have shown strong performance, they often rely on a single, generalized reasoning strategy, overlooking the unique characteristics of each modality ultimately limiting both accuracy and interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose MAMMQA, a multi-agent QA framework for multimodal inputs spanning text, tables, and images. Our system includes two Visual Language Model (VLM) agents and one text-based Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The first VLM decomposes the user query into sub-questions and sequentially retrieves partial answers from each modality. The second VLM synthesizes and refines these results through cross-modal reasoning. Finally, the LLM integrates the insights into a cohesive answer. This modular design enhances interpretability by making the reasoning process transparent and allows each agent to operate within its domain of expertise. Experiments on diverse multimodal QA benchmarks demonstrate that our cooperative, multi-agent framework consistently outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[RRO: LLM Agent Optimization Through Rising Reward Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20737v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited extraordinary performance in a variety of tasks while it remains challenging for them to solve complex multi-step tasks as agents. In practice, agents sensitive to the outcome of certain key steps which makes them likely to fail the task because of a subtle mistake in the planning trajectory. Recent approaches resort to calibrating the reasoning process through reinforcement learning. They reward or penalize every reasoning step with process supervision, as known as Process Reward Models (PRMs). However, PRMs are difficult and costly to scale up with a large number of next action candidates since they require extensive computations to acquire the training data through the per-step trajectory exploration. To mitigate this issue, we focus on the relative reward trend across successive reasoning steps and propose maintaining an increasing reward in the collected trajectories for process supervision, which we term Reward Rising Optimization (RRO). Specifically, we incrementally augment the process supervision until identifying a step exhibiting positive reward differentials, i.e. rising rewards, relative to its preceding iteration. This method dynamically expands the search space for the next action candidates, efficiently capturing high-quality data. We provide mathematical groundings and empirical results on the WebShop and InterCode-SQL benchmarks, showing that our proposed RRO achieves superior performance while requiring much less exploration cost.</p></details> | preprint |

We introduce RULEARN, a novel benchmark to assess the rule-learning abilities of LLM agents in interactive settings. In RULEARN, agents strategically interact with simulated environments to gather observations, discern patterns, and solve complex problems. To enhance the rule-learning capabilities for LLM agents, we propose IDEA, a novel reasoning framework that integrates the process of Induction, Deduction, and Abduction. The IDEA agent generates initial hypotheses from limited observations through abduction, devises plans to validate these hypotheses or leverages them to solve problems via deduction, and refines previous hypotheses through induction, dynamically establishing and applying rules that mimic human rule-learning behaviors. Our evaluation of the IDEA framework, which involves five representative LLMs, demonstrates significant improvements over the baseline. Furthermore, our study with human participants reveals notable discrepancies in rule-learning behaviors between humans and LLMs. We believe our benchmark will serve as a valuable and challenging resource, and IDEA will provide crucial insights for the development of LLM agents capable of human-like rule learning in real-world scenarios. Our code and data is publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 Findings</p></details> |
| **[SPA-RL: Reinforcing LLM Agents via Stepwise Progress Attribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20732v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) holds significant promise for training LLM agents to handle complex, goal-oriented tasks that require multi-step interactions with external environments. However, a critical challenge when applying RL to these agentic tasks arises from delayed rewards: feedback signals are typically available only after the entire task is completed. This makes it non-trivial to assign delayed rewards to earlier actions, providing insufficient guidance regarding environmental constraints and hindering agent training. In this work, we draw on the insight that the ultimate completion of a task emerges from the cumulative progress an agent makes across individual steps. We propose Stepwise Progress Attribution (SPA), a general reward redistribution framework that decomposes the final reward into stepwise contributions, each reflecting its incremental progress toward overall task completion. To achieve this, we train a progress estimator that accumulates stepwise contributions over a trajectory to match the task completion. During policy optimization, we combine the estimated per-step contribution with a grounding signal for actions executed in the environment as the fine-grained, intermediate reward for effective agent training. Extensive experiments on common agent benchmarks (including Webshop, ALFWorld, and VirtualHome) demonstrate that SPA consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art method in both success rate (+2.5\% on average) and grounding accuracy (+1.9\% on average). Further analyses demonstrate that our method remarkably provides more effective intermediate rewards for RL training.

| **[A-MEM: Agentic Memory for LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12110v8)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language model (LLM) agents can effectively use external tools for complex real-world tasks, they require memory systems to leverage historical experiences. Current memory systems enable basic storage and retrieval but lack sophisticated memory organization, despite recent attempts to incorporate graph databases. Moreover, these systems' fixed operations and structures limit their adaptability across diverse tasks. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel agentic memory system for LLM agents that can dynamically organize memories in an agentic way. Following the basic principles of the Zettelkasten method, we designed our memory system to create interconnected knowledge networks through dynamic indexing and linking. When a new memory is added, we generate a comprehensive note containing multiple structured attributes, including contextual descriptions, keywords, and tags. The system then analyzes historical memories to identify relevant connections, establishing links where meaningful similarities exist. Additionally, this process enables memory evolution - as new memories are integrated, they can trigger updates to the contextual representations and attributes of existing historical memories, allowing the memory network to continuously refine its understanding. Our approach combines the structured organization principles of Zettelkasten with the flexibility of agent-driven decision making, allowing for more adaptive and context-aware memory management. Empirical experiments on six foundation models show superior improvement against existing SOTA baselines. The source code for evaluating performance is available at https://github.com/WujiangXu/AgenticMemory, while the source code of agentic memory system is available at https://github.com/agiresearch/A-mem.</p></details> |  |

However, existing LLM agent frameworks have not fully utilized past experiences for improvement. This work introduces a new LLM-based agent framework called Retrospex, which addresses this challenge by analyzing past experiences in depth. Unlike previous approaches, Retrospex does not directly integrate experiences into the LLM's context. Instead, it combines the LLM's action likelihood with action values estimated by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) Critic, which is trained on past experiences through an offline ''retrospection'' process. Additionally, Retrospex employs a dynamic action rescoring mechanism that increases the importance of experience-based values for tasks that require more interaction with the environment. We evaluate Retrospex in ScienceWorld, ALFWorld and Webshop environments, demonstrating its advantages over strong, contemporary baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, Published in EMNLP 2024 (Proceedings of the 2024 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing)</p></details> |
| **[DCA-Bench: A Benchmark for Dataset Curation Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07275v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quality of datasets plays an increasingly crucial role in the research and development of modern artificial intelligence (AI). Despite the proliferation of open dataset platforms nowadays, data quality issues, such as incomplete documentation, inaccurate labels, ethical concerns, and outdated information, remain common in widely used datasets. Furthermore, these issues are often subtle and difficult to be detected by rule-based scripts, therefore requiring identification and verification by dataset users or maintainers--a process that is both time-consuming and prone to human mistakes. With the surging ability of large language models (LLM), it's promising to streamline the discovery of hidden dataset issues with LLM agents. To achieve this, one significant challenge is enabling LLM agents to detect issues in the wild rather than simply fixing known ones. In this work, we establish a benchmark to measure LLM agent's ability to tackle this challenge. We carefully curate 221 real-world test cases from eight popular dataset platforms and propose an automatic evaluation framework using GPT-4o. Our proposed framework shows strong empirical alignment with expert evaluations, validated through extensive comparisons with human annotations. Without any hints, most competitive Curator agent can only reveal $\sim$30\% of the data quality issues in the proposed dataset, highlighting the complexity of this task and indicating that applying LLM agents to real-world dataset curation still requires further in-depth exploration and innovation.

While reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled progress in static tasks, multi-turn agent RL training remains underexplored. We propose StarPO (State-Thinking-Actions-Reward Policy Optimization), a general framework for trajectory-level agent RL, and introduce RAGEN, a modular system for training and evaluating LLM agents. Our study on four stylized environments reveals three core findings. First, our agent RL training shows a recurring mode of Echo Trap where reward variance cliffs and gradient spikes; we address this with StarPO-S, a stabilized variant with trajectory filtering, critic incorporation, and gradient stabilization. Second, we find the shaping of RL rollouts would benefit from diverse initial states, medium interaction granularity and more frequent sampling. Third, we show that without fine-grained, reasoning-aware reward signals, agent reasoning hardly emerge through multi-turn RL and they may show shallow strategies or hallucinated thoughts. Code and environments are available at https://github.com/RAGEN-AI/RAGEN.</p></details> |  |

However, current powerful agents often depend on sophisticated prompt engineering combined with closed-source LLMs like GPT-4. Although training open-source LLMs using expert trajectories from teacher models has yielded some improvements in agent capabilities, this approach still faces limitations such as performance plateauing and error propagation. To mitigate these challenges, we propose STeP, a novel method for improving LLM-based agent training. We synthesize self-reflected trajectories that include reflections and corrections of error steps, which enhance the effectiveness of LLM agents in learning from teacher models, enabling them to become agents capable of self-reflecting and correcting. We also introduce partial masking strategy that prevents the LLM from internalizing incorrect or suboptimal steps. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves agent performance across three representative tasks: ALFWorld, WebShop, and SciWorld. For the open-source model LLaMA2-7B-Chat, when trained using self-reflected trajectories constructed with Qwen1.5-110B-Chat as the teacher model, it achieves comprehensive improvements with less training data compared to agents trained exclusively on expert trajectories.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce EMAC+, an Embodied Multimodal Agent that collaboratively integrates LLM and VLM via a bidirectional training paradigm. Unlike existing methods, EMAC+ dynamically refines high-level textual plans generated by an LLM using real-time feedback from a VLM executing low-level visual control tasks. We address critical limitations of previous models by enabling the LLM to internalize visual environment dynamics directly through interactive experience, rather than relying solely on static symbolic mappings. Extensive experimental evaluations on ALFWorld and RT-1 benchmarks demonstrate that EMAC+ achieves superior task performance, robustness against noisy observations, and efficient learning. We also conduct thorough ablation studies and provide detailed analyses of success and failure cases.</p></details> |  |

We intend to apply these concepts to the field of Control in space, enabling LLMs to play a significant role in the decision-making process for autonomous satellite operations. As a first step towards this goal, we have developed a pure LLM-based solution for the Kerbal Space Program Differential Games (KSPDG) challenge, a public software design competition where participants create autonomous agents for maneuvering satellites involved in non-cooperative space operations, running on the KSP game engine.

Current work neglects these agentic networks and their challenges. We identify required properties for agent communication: proactivity, adaptability, privacy (sharing only task-necessary information), and security (preserving integrity and utility against selfish entities). After demonstrating communication vulnerabilities, we propose a practical design and protocol inspired by network security principles. Our framework automatically derives task-specific rules from prior conversations to build firewalls. These firewalls construct a closed language that is completely controlled by the developer. They transform any personal data to the allowed degree of permissibility entailed by the task. Both operations are completely quarantined from external attackers, disabling the potential for prompt injections, jailbreaks, or manipulation. By incorporating rules learned from their previous mistakes, agents rewrite their instructions and self-correct during communication. Evaluations on diverse attacks demonstrate our framework significantly reduces privacy and security vulnerabilities while allowing adaptability.</p></details> |  |

While enabling LLMs to interact with external knowledge environments is a promising solution, current efforts primarily address closed-end problems. Open-ended questions, which characterized by lacking a standard answer or providing non-unique and diverse answers, remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present O$^2$-Searcher, a novel search agent leveraging reinforcement learning to effectively tackle both open-ended and closed-ended questions in the open domain. O$^2$-Searcher leverages an efficient, locally simulated search environment for dynamic knowledge acquisition, effectively decoupling the external world knowledge from model's sophisticated reasoning processes. It employs a unified training mechanism with meticulously designed reward functions, enabling the agent to identify problem types and adapt different answer generation strategies. Furthermore, to evaluate performance on complex open-ended tasks, we construct O$^2$-QA, a high-quality benchmark featuring 300 manually curated, multi-domain open-ended questions with associated web page caches. Extensive experiments show that O$^2$-Searcher, using only a 3B model, significantly surpasses leading LLM agents on O$^2$-QA. It also achieves SOTA results on various closed-ended QA benchmarks against similarly-sized models, while performing on par with much larger ones.</p></details> | 25 pages, 9 figures |

While retrieval augmented generation (RAG) shows great promise in large language model (LLM) based automated question answering, previous works often isolate neural and symbolic retrieval despite their complementary strengths. Moreover, conventional single-view chunking neglects the rich structure and layout of PDFs, e.g., sections and tables. In this work, we propose NeuSym-RAG, a hybrid neural symbolic retrieval framework which combines both paradigms in an interactive process. By leveraging multi-view chunking and schema-based parsing, NeuSym-RAG organizes semi-structured PDF content into both the relational database and vectorstore, enabling LLM agents to iteratively gather context until sufficient to generate answers.

| **[FamilyTool: A Multi-hop Personalized Tool Use Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06766v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of tool learning with Large Language Models (LLMs) has expanded their capabilities in handling complex tasks by leveraging external tools. However, existing benchmarks for tool learning inadequately address critical real-world personalized scenarios, particularly those requiring multi-hop reasoning and inductive knowledge adaptation in dynamic environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce FamilyTool, a novel benchmark grounded in a family-based knowledge graph (KG) that simulates personalized, multi-hop tool use scenarios. FamilyTool, including base and extended datasets, challenges LLMs with queries spanning from 1 to 4 relational hops (e.g., inferring familial connections and preferences) and 2 to 6 hops respectively, and incorporates an inductive KG setting where models must adapt to unseen user preferences and relationships without re-training, a common limitation in prior approaches that compromises generalization. We further propose KGETool: a simple KG-augmented evaluation pipeline to systematically assess LLMs' tool use ability in these settings. Experiments reveal significant performance gaps in state-of-the-art LLMs, with accuracy dropping sharply as hop complexity increases and inductive scenarios exposing severe generalization deficits. These findings underscore the limitations of current LLMs in handling personalized, evolving real-world contexts and highlight the urgent need for advancements in tool-learning frameworks. FamilyTool serves as a critical resource for evaluating and advancing LLM agents' reasoning, adaptability, and scalability in complex, dynamic environments.

| **[LLM-Agent-Controller: A Universal Multi-Agent Large Language Model System as a Control Engineer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19567v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents the LLM-Agent-Controller, a multi-agent large language model (LLM) system developed to address a wide range of problems in control engineering (Control Theory). The system integrates a central controller agent with multiple specialized auxiliary agents, responsible for tasks such as controller design, model representation, control analysis, time-domain response, and simulation. A supervisor oversees high-level decision-making and workflow coordination, enhancing the system's reliability and efficiency. The LLM-Agent-Controller incorporates advanced capabilities, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Chain-of-Thought reasoning, self-criticism and correction, efficient memory handling, and user-friendly natural language communication. It is designed to function without requiring users to have prior knowledge of Control Theory, enabling them to input problems in plain language and receive complete, real-time solutions. To evaluate the system, we propose new performance metrics assessing both individual agents and the system as a whole. We test five categories of Control Theory problems and benchmark performance across three advanced LLMs. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive qualitative conversational analysis covering all key services. Results show that the LLM-Agent-Controller successfully solved 83% of general tasks, with individual agents achieving an average success rate of 87%. Performance improved with more advanced LLMs. This research demonstrates the potential of multi-agent LLM architectures to solve complex, domain-specific problems. By integrating specialized agents, supervisory control, and advanced reasoning, the LLM-Agent-Controller offers a scalable, robust, and accessible solution framework that can be extended to various technical domains.</p></details> |  |

Bugs in the Linux kernel can cause serious consequences, affecting billions of users. Fault localization (FL), which aims at identifying the buggy code elements in software, plays an essential role in software quality assurance. While recent LLM agents have achieved promising accuracy in FL on recent benchmarks like SWE-bench, it remains unclear how well these methods perform in the Linux kernel, where FL is much more challenging due to the large-scale code base, limited observability, and diverse impact factors. In this paper, we introduce LinuxFLBench, a FL benchmark constructed from real-world Linux kernel bugs. We conduct an empirical study to assess the performance of state-of-the-art LLM agents on the Linux kernel. Our initial results reveal that existing agents struggle with this task, achieving a best top-1 accuracy of only 41.6% at file level. To address this challenge, we propose LinuxFL$^+$, an enhancement framework designed to improve FL effectiveness of LLM agents for the Linux kernel. LinuxFL$^+$ substantially improves the FL accuracy of all studied agents (e.g., 7.2% - 11.2% accuracy increase) with minimal costs. Data and code are available at https://github.com/FudanSELab/LinuxFLBench.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods - ranging from rule-based heuristics to reinforcement learning (RL) - often struggle to generalize to complex, dynamic, and safety-critical scenarios. We introduce VLMLight, a novel TSC framework that integrates vision-language meta-control with dual-branch reasoning. At the core of VLMLight is the first image-based traffic simulator that enables multi-view visual perception at intersections, allowing policies to reason over rich cues such as vehicle type, motion, and spatial density. A large language model (LLM) serves as a safety-prioritized meta-controller, selecting between a fast RL policy for routine traffic and a structured reasoning branch for critical cases. In the latter, multiple LLM agents collaborate to assess traffic phases, prioritize emergency vehicles, and verify rule compliance. Experiments show that VLMLight reduces waiting times for emergency vehicles by up to 65% over RL-only systems, while preserving real-time performance in standard conditions with less than 1% degradation. VLMLight offers a scalable, interpretable, and safety-aware solution for next-generation traffic signal control.</p></details> | 25 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Task Memory Engine: Spatial Memory for Robust Multi-Step LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19436v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) falter in multi-step interactions -- often hallucinating, repeating actions, or misinterpreting user corrections -- due to reliance on linear, unstructured context. This fragility stems from the lack of persistent memory to track evolving goals and task dependencies, undermining trust in autonomous agents. We introduce the Task Memory Engine (TME), a modular memory controller that transforms existing LLMs into robust, revision-aware agents without fine-tuning. TME implements a spatial memory framework that replaces flat context with graph-based structures to support consistent, multi-turn reasoning. Departing from linear concatenation and ReAct-style prompting, TME builds a dynamic task graph -- either a tree or directed acyclic graph (DAG) -- to map user inputs to subtasks, align them with prior context, and enable dependency-tracked revisions. Its Task Representation and Intent Management (TRIM) component models task semantics and user intent to ensure accurate interpretation. Across four multi-turn scenarios-trip planning, cooking, meeting scheduling, and shopping cart editing -- TME eliminates 100% of hallucinations and misinterpretations in three tasks, and reduces hallucinations by 66.7% and misinterpretations by 83.3% across 27 user turns, outperforming ReAct. TME's modular design supports plug-and-play deployment and domain-specific customization, adaptable to both personal assistants and enterprise automation. We release TME's codebase, benchmarks, and components as open-source resources, enabling researchers to develop reliable LLM agents. TME's scalable architecture addresses a critical gap in agent performance across complex, interactive settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review. 9 pages main content, 15 pages appendix, 5 figures</p></details> |

An Empirical Evaluation of Agentic Capabilities in LLM Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19433v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training compression reduces the computational and memory costs of large language models (LLMs), enabling resource-efficient deployment. However, existing compression benchmarks only focus on language modeling (e.g., perplexity) and natural language understanding tasks (e.g., GLUE accuracy), ignoring the agentic capabilities - workflow, tool use/function call, long-context understanding and real-world application. We introduce the Agent Compression Benchmark (ACBench), the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how compression impacts LLMs' agentic abilities. ACBench spans (1) 12 tasks across 4 capabilities (e.g., WorfBench for workflow generation, Needle-in-Haystack for long-context retrieval), (2) quantization (GPTQ, AWQ) and pruning (Wanda, SparseGPT), and (3) 15 models, including small (Gemma-2B), standard (Qwen2.5 7B-32B), and distilled reasoning LLMs (DeepSeek-R1-Distill). Our experiments reveal compression tradeoffs: 4-bit quantization preserves workflow generation and tool use (1%-3% drop) but degrades real-world application accuracy by 10%-15%. We introduce ERank, Top-k Ranking Correlation and Energy to systematize analysis. ACBench provides actionable insights for optimizing LLM compression in agentic scenarios. The code can be found in https://github.com/pprp/ACBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML2025 as Poster</p></details> |

To address this challenge, we propose a novel RObust mUltitask Tuning and collaboration mEthod (ROUTE) to improve the comprehensive capabilities of open-source LLMs for Text2SQL, thereby providing a more practical solution. Our approach begins with multi-task supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using various synthetic training data related to SQL generation. Unlike existing SFT-based Text2SQL methods, we introduced several additional SFT tasks, including schema linking, noise correction, and continuation writing. Engaging in a variety of SQL generation tasks enhances the model's understanding of SQL syntax and improves its ability to generate high-quality SQL queries. Additionally, inspired by the collaborative modes of LLM agents, we introduce a Multitask Collaboration Prompting (MCP) strategy. This strategy leverages collaboration across several SQL-related tasks to reduce hallucinations during SQL generation, thereby maximizing the potential of enhancing Text2SQL performance through explicit multitask capabilities. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses have been performed on eight open-source LLMs and five widely-used benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our proposal outperforms the latest Text2SQL methods and yields leading performance.</p></details> |  |

This simulation combines LLM agents with a directed social graph to analyze emergent deception behaviors and gain a better understanding of how users determine the veracity of online social content. By constructing user representations from diverse fine-grained personas, our system enables multi-agent simulations that model content dissemination and engagement dynamics at scale. Within this framework, we evaluate three different content moderation strategies with simulated misinformation dissemination, and we find that they not only mitigate the spread of non-factual content but also increase user engagement. In addition, we analyze the trajectories of popular content in our simulations, and explore whether simulation agents' articulated reasoning for their social interactions truly aligns with their collective engagement patterns. We open-source our simulation software to encourage further research within AI and social sciences.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress. 27 pages</p></details> |

Evaluating LLM Agent Simulation Methodologies with Real-World Online Customer Behavior Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20749v5)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research shows that LLMs can simulate ``believable'' human behaviors to power LLM agents via prompt-only methods. In this work, we focus on evaluating LLM's objective ``accuracy'' rather than the subjective ``believability'' in simulating human behavior, leveraging a large-scale, real-world dataset collected from customers' online shopping actions. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, Llama, and Claude) on the task of web shopping action generation. Our results show that out-of-the-box LLM-generated actions are often misaligned with actual human behavior, whereas fine-tuning LLMs on real-world behavioral data substantially improves their ability to generate accurate actions compared to prompt-only methods. Furthermore, incorporating synthesized reasonings into model training leads to additional performance gains, demonstrating the value of explicit rationale in behavior modeling. This work evaluates state-of-the-art LLMs in behavior simulation and provides actionable insights into how real-world action data can enhance the fidelity of LLM agents.</p></details> |  |

However, their deployment raises serious safety concerns. Existing defenses largely rely on "Safety Checks", which struggle to capture the complex semantic risks posed by harmful user inputs or unsafe agent behaviors - creating a significant semantic gap between safety checks and real-world risks. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel defense framework, ALRPHFS (Adversarially Learned Risk Patterns with Hierarchical Fast & Slow Reasoning). ALRPHFS consists of two core components: (1) an offline adversarial self-learning loop to iteratively refine a generalizable and balanced library of risk patterns, substantially enhancing robustness without retraining the base LLM, and (2) an online hierarchical fast & slow reasoning engine that balances detection effectiveness with computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior overall performance compared to existing baselines, achieving a best-in-class average accuracy of 80% and exhibiting strong generalizability across agents and tasks.</p></details> | 19 pages, 2 figures |

While prior work has examined both LLMs' moral judgment and strategic behavior in social dilemmas, there is limited understanding of how they act when moral imperatives directly conflict with rewards or incentives. To investigate this, we introduce Moral Behavior in Social Dilemma Simulation (MoralSim) and evaluate how LLMs behave in the prisoner's dilemma and public goods game with morally charged contexts. In MoralSim, we test a range of frontier models across both game structures and three distinct moral framings, enabling a systematic examination of how LLMs navigate social dilemmas in which ethical norms conflict with payoff-maximizing strategies. Our results show substantial variation across models in both their general tendency to act morally and the consistency of their behavior across game types, the specific moral framing, and situational factors such as opponent behavior and survival risks. Crucially, no model exhibits consistently moral behavior in MoralSim, highlighting the need for caution when deploying LLMs in agentic roles where the agent's "self-interest" may conflict with ethical expectations.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise as tools to simulate such complex pedagogical environments, current simulation frameworks are limited in two key respects: (1) they often reduce students to static knowledge profiles, and (2) they lack adaptive mechanisms for modeling teachers who evolve their strategies in response to student feedback. To address these gaps, \textbf{we introduce a novel simulation framework that integrates LLM-based heterogeneous student agents with a self-optimizing teacher agent}. The teacher agent's pedagogical policy is dynamically evolved using a genetic algorithm, allowing it to discover and refine effective teaching strategies based on the aggregate performance of diverse learners. In addition, \textbf{we propose Persona-RAG}, a Retrieval Augmented Generation module that enables student agents to retrieve knowledge tailored to their individual learning styles. Persona-RAG preserves the retrieval accuracy of standard RAG baselines while enhancing personalization, an essential factor in modeling realistic educational scenarios. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate how our framework supports the emergence of distinct and interpretable teaching patterns when interacting with varied student populations. Our results highlight the potential of LLM-driven simulations to inform adaptive teaching practices and provide a testbed for training human educators in controlled, data-driven environments.</p></details> | 38 Pages |

This complex process involves gathering information about the target system, identifying entry points, exploiting the system, and reporting findings. Despite its effectiveness, manual penetration testing is time-consuming and expensive, often requiring significant expertise and resources that many organizations cannot afford. While automated penetration testing methods have been proposed, they often fall short in real-world applications due to limitations in flexibility, adaptability, and implementation. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for enhancing penetration testing through increased intelligence and automation. However, current LLM-based approaches still face significant challenges, including limited penetration testing knowledge and a lack of comprehensive automation capabilities. To address these gaps, we propose PentestAgent, a novel LLM-based automated penetration testing framework that leverages the power of LLMs and various LLM-based techniques like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance penetration testing knowledge and automate various tasks. Our framework leverages multi-agent collaboration to automate intelligence gathering, vulnerability analysis, and exploitation stages, reducing manual intervention. We evaluate PentestAgent using a comprehensive benchmark, demonstrating superior performance in task completion and overall efficiency.

However, the defect of recommendation algorithms may put users in very vulnerable positions under this paradigm. First, many sophisticated models are often designed with commercial objectives in mind, focusing on the platform's benefits, which may hinder their ability to protect and capture users' true interests. Second, these models are typically optimized using data from all users, which may overlook individual user's preferences. Due to these shortcomings, users may experience several disadvantages under the traditional user-platform direct exposure paradigm, such as lack of control over the recommender system, potential manipulation by the platform, echo chamber effects, or lack of personalization for less active users due to the dominance of active users during collaborative learning. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a new paradigm to protect user interests and alleviate these issues. Recently, some researchers have introduced LLM agents to simulate user behaviors, these approaches primarily aim to optimize platform-side performance, leaving core issues in recommender systems unresolved. To address these limitations, we propose a new user-agent-platform paradigm, where agent serves as the protective shield between user and recommender system that enables indirect exposure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of ACL 2025 and WWW2025@HCRS</p></details> |
| **[MELON: Provable Indirect Prompt Injection Defense via Masked Re-execution and Tool Comparison](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05174v3)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has explored that LLM agents are vulnerable to indirect prompt injection (IPI) attacks, where malicious tasks embedded in tool-retrieved information can redirect the agent to take unauthorized actions. Existing defenses against IPI have significant limitations: either require essential model training resources, lack effectiveness against sophisticated attacks, or harm the normal utilities. We present MELON (Masked re-Execution and TooL comparisON), a novel IPI defense. Our approach builds on the observation that under a successful attack, the agent's next action becomes less dependent on user tasks and more on malicious tasks. Following this, we design MELON to detect attacks by re-executing the agent's trajectory with a masked user prompt modified through a masking function. We identify an attack if the actions generated in the original and masked executions are similar. We also include three key designs to reduce the potential false positives and false negatives. Extensive evaluation on the IPI benchmark AgentDojo demonstrates that MELON outperforms SOTA defenses in both attack prevention and utility preservation. Moreover, we show that combining MELON with a SOTA prompt augmentation defense (denoted as MELON-Aug) further improves its performance. We also conduct a detailed ablation study to validate our key designs. Code is available at https://github.com/kaijiezhu11/MELON.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Security Concerns for Large Language Models: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18889v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 (and its recent iterations like GPT-4o and the GPT-4.1 series), Google's Gemini, Anthropic's Claude 3 models, and xAI's Grok have caused a revolution in natural language processing, but their capabilities also introduce new security vulnerabilities. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of the emerging security concerns around LLMs, categorizing threats into prompt injection and jailbreaking, adversarial attacks (including input perturbations and data poisoning), misuse by malicious actors (e.g., for disinformation, phishing, and malware generation), and worrisome risks inherent in autonomous LLM agents. A significant focus has been recently placed on the latter, exploring goal misalignment, emergent deception, self-preservation instincts, and the potential for LLMs to develop and pursue covert, misaligned objectives (scheming), which may even persist through safety training. We summarize recent academic and industrial studies (2022-2025) that exemplify each threat, analyze proposed defenses and their limitations, and identify open challenges in securing LLM-based applications. We conclude by emphasizing the importance of advancing robust, multi-layered security strategies to ensure LLMs are safe and beneficial.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks often lack fidelity in their environments, data, and agent-user interactions, with limited coverage of diverse business scenarios and industries. To address these gaps, we introduce CRMArena-Pro, a novel benchmark for holistic, realistic assessment of LLM agents in diverse professional settings. CRMArena-Pro expands on CRMArena with nineteen expert-validated tasks across sales, service, and 'configure, price, and quote' processes, for both Business-to-Business and Business-to-Customer scenarios. It distinctively incorporates multi-turn interactions guided by diverse personas and robust confidentiality awareness assessments. Experiments reveal leading LLM agents achieve only around 58% single-turn success on CRMArena-Pro, with performance dropping significantly to approximately 35% in multi-turn settings. While Workflow Execution proves more tractable for top agents (over 83% single-turn success), other evaluated business skills present greater challenges. Furthermore, agents exhibit near-zero inherent confidentiality awareness; though targeted prompting can improve this, it often compromises task performance. These findings highlight a substantial gap between current LLM capabilities and enterprise demands, underscoring the need for advancements in multi-turn reasoning, confidentiality adherence, and versatile skill acquisition.</p></details> |  |

However, this integration introduces new security vulnerabilities, particularly to poisoning attacks. Although prior work has explored various poisoning strategies, a thorough assessment of their practical threat to RAG systems remains missing. To address this gap, we propose the first comprehensive benchmark framework for evaluating poisoning attacks on RAG. Our benchmark covers 5 standard question answering (QA) datasets and 10 expanded variants, along with 13 poisoning attack methods and 7 defense mechanisms, representing a broad spectrum of existing techniques. Using this benchmark, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of all included attacks and defenses across the full dataset spectrum. Our findings show that while existing attacks perform well on standard QA datasets, their effectiveness drops significantly on the expanded versions. Moreover, our results demonstrate that various advanced RAG architectures, such as sequential, branching, conditional, and loop RAG, as well as multi-turn conversational RAG, multimodal RAG systems, and RAG-based LLM agent systems, remain susceptible to poisoning attacks. Notably, current defense techniques fail to provide robust protection, underscoring the pressing need for more resilient and generalizable defense strategies.</p></details> |  |

This imbalance leads to Tool Overuse, where models unnecessarily rely on external tools for tasks solvable with parametric knowledge, increasing computational overhead. Inspired by human metacognition, we introduce SMART (Strategic Model-Aware Reasoning with Tools), a paradigm that enhances an agent's self-awareness to optimize task handling and reduce tool overuse. To support this paradigm, we introduce SMART-ER, a dataset spanning three domains, where reasoning alternates between parametric knowledge and tool-dependent steps, with each step enriched by rationales explaining when tools are necessary. Through supervised training, we develop SMARTAgent, a family of models that dynamically balance parametric knowledge and tool use. Evaluations show that SMARTAgent reduces tool use by 24% while improving performance by over 37%, enabling 7B-scale models to match its 70B counterpart and GPT-4o. Additionally, SMARTAgent generalizes to out-of-distribution test data like GSM8K and MINTQA, maintaining accuracy with just one-fifth the tool calls. These highlight the potential of strategic tool use to enhance reasoning, mitigate overuse, and bridge the gap between model size and performance, advancing intelligent and resource-efficient agent designs.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 11 tables, 7 figures, ACL 2025 Findings</p></details> |

We introduce a Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) agent design framework for designing, evaluating, and implementing psychologically grounded LLMs with consistent behavior. Our framework operationalizes SCT through four personal factors (cognitive, motivational, biological, and affective) for designing, six quantifiable constructs for evaluating, and a graph database-backed architecture for implementing stakeholder personas. Experiments tested agents' responses to contradicting information of varying reliability. In the highly polarized renewable energy transition discourse, we design five diverse agents with distinct ideologies, roles, and stakes to examine stakeholder representation. The evaluation of these agents in contradictory scenarios occurs through comprehensive processes that implement the SCT. Results show consistent response patterns ($R^2$ range: $0.58-0.61$) and systematic temporal development of SCT construct effects. Principal component analysis identifies two dimensions explaining $73$% of variance, validating the theoretical structure. Our framework offers improved explainability and reproducibility compared to black-box approaches. This work contributes to ongoing efforts to improve diverse stakeholder representation while maintaining psychological consistency in LLM personas.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Natural Language Communication for Cooperative Autonomous Driving via Self-Play](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18334v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Past work has demonstrated that autonomous vehicles can drive more safely if they communicate with one another than if they do not. However, their communication has often not been human-understandable. Using natural language as a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication protocol offers the potential for autonomous vehicles to drive cooperatively not only with each other but also with human drivers. In this work, we propose a suite of traffic tasks in autonomous driving where vehicles in a traffic scenario need to communicate in natural language to facilitate coordination in order to avoid an imminent collision and/or support efficient traffic flow. To this end, this paper introduces a novel method, LLM+Debrief, to learn a message generation and high-level decision-making policy for autonomous vehicles through multi-agent discussion. To evaluate LLM agents for driving, we developed a gym-like simulation environment that contains a range of driving scenarios. Our experimental results demonstrate that LLM+Debrief is more effective at generating meaningful and human-understandable natural language messages to facilitate cooperation and coordination than a zero-shot LLM agent. Our code and demo videos are available at https://talking-vehicles.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

Why Not Both?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18286v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems (MAS) decompose complex tasks and delegate subtasks to different large language model (LLM) agents and tools. Prior studies have reported the superior accuracy performance of MAS across diverse domains, enabled by long-horizon context tracking and error correction through role-specific agents. However, the design and deployment of MAS incur higher complexity and runtime cost compared to single-agent systems (SAS). Meanwhile, frontier LLMs, such as OpenAI-o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro, have rapidly advanced in long-context reasoning, memory retention, and tool usage, mitigating many limitations that originally motivated MAS designs. In this paper, we conduct an extensive empirical study comparing MAS and SAS across various popular agentic applications. We find that the benefits of MAS over SAS diminish as LLM capabilities improve, and we propose efficient mechanisms to pinpoint the error-prone agent in MAS. Furthermore, the performance discrepancy between MAS and SAS motivates our design of a hybrid agentic paradigm, request cascading between MAS and SAS, to improve both efficiency and capability.

While persistent memory has been shown to enhance single-agent performance, most approaches assume a monolithic, single-user context-overlooking the benefits and challenges of knowledge transfer across users under dynamic, asymmetric permissions. We introduce Collaborative Memory, a framework for multi-user, multi-agent environments with asymmetric, time-evolving access controls encoded as bipartite graphs linking users, agents, and resources. Our system maintains two memory tiers: (1) private memory-private fragments visible only to their originating user; and (2) shared memory-selectively shared fragments. Each fragment carries immutable provenance attributes (contributing agents, accessed resources, and timestamps) to support retrospective permission checks. Granular read policies enforce current user-agent-resource constraints and project existing memory fragments into filtered transformed views. Write policies determine fragment retention and sharing, applying context-aware transformations to update the memory. Both policies may be designed conditioned on system, agent, and user-level information. Our framework enables safe, efficient, and interpretable cross-user knowledge sharing, with provable adherence to asymmetric, time-varying policies and full auditability of memory operations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Planning without Search: Refining Frontier LLMs with Offline Goal-Conditioned RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18098v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel in tasks like question answering and dialogue, but complex tasks requiring interaction, such as negotiation and persuasion, require additional long-horizon reasoning and planning. Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning can enable such planning in principle, but suffers from drawbacks that hinder scalability. In particular, multi-turn RL training incurs high memory and computational costs, which are exacerbated when training LLMs as policies. Furthermore, the largest LLMs do not expose the APIs necessary to be trained in such manner. As a result, modern methods to improve the reasoning of LLMs rely on sophisticated prompting mechanisms rather than RL fine-tuning. To remedy this, we propose a novel approach that uses goal-conditioned value functions to guide the reasoning of LLM agents, that scales even to large API-based models. These value functions predict how a task will unfold given an action, allowing the LLM agent to evaluate multiple possible outcomes, both positive and negative, to plan effectively. In addition, these value functions are trained over reasoning steps rather than full actions, to be a concise and light-weight module that facilitates decision-making in multi-turn interactions. We validate our method on tasks requiring interaction, including tool use, social deduction, and dialogue, demonstrating superior performance over both RL fine-tuning and prompting methods while maintaining efficiency and scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

We introduce DialogXpert, which leverages a frozen LLM to propose a small, high-quality set of candidate actions per turn and employs a compact Q-network over fixed BERT embeddings trained via temporal-difference learning to select optimal moves within this reduced space. By tracking the user's emotions, DialogXpert tailors each decision to advance the task while nurturing a genuine, empathetic connection. Across negotiation, emotional support, and tutoring benchmarks, DialogXpert drives conversations to under $3$ turns with success rates exceeding 94\% and, with a larger LLM prior, pushes success above 97\% while markedly improving negotiation outcomes. This framework delivers real-time, strategic, and emotionally intelligent dialogue planning at scale. Code available at https://github.com/declare-lab/dialogxpert/</p></details> |  |
| **[The Real Barrier to LLM Agent Usability is Agentic ROI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17767v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents represent a promising shift in human-AI interaction, moving beyond passive prompt-response systems to autonomous agents capable of reasoning, planning, and goal-directed action. Despite the widespread application in specialized, high-effort tasks like coding and scientific research, we highlight a critical usability gap in high-demand, mass-market applications. This position paper argues that the limited real-world adoption of LLM agents stems not only from gaps in model capabilities, but also from a fundamental tradeoff between the value an agent can provide and the costs incurred during real-world use. Hence, we call for a shift from solely optimizing model performance to a broader, utility-driven perspective: evaluating agents through the lens of the overall agentic return on investment (Agent ROI). By identifying key factors that determine Agentic ROI--information quality, agent time, and cost--we posit a zigzag development trajectory in optimizing agentic ROI: first scaling up to improve the information quality, then scaling down to minimize the time and cost. We outline the roadmap across different development stages to bridge the current usability gaps, aiming to make LLM agents truly scalable, accessible, and effective in real-world contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Get Experience from Practice: LLM Agents with Record & Replay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17716v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI agents, empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and communication protocols such as MCP and A2A, have rapidly evolved from simple chatbots to autonomous entities capable of executing complex, multi-step tasks, demonstrating great potential. However, the LLMs' inherent uncertainty and heavy computational resource requirements pose four significant challenges to the development of safe and efficient agents: reliability, privacy, cost and performance. Existing approaches, like model alignment, workflow constraints and on-device model deployment, can partially alleviate some issues but often with limitations, failing to fundamentally resolve these challenges. This paper proposes a new paradigm called AgentRR (Agent Record & Replay), which introduces the classical record-and-replay mechanism into AI agent frameworks. The core idea is to: 1. Record an agent's interaction trace with its environment and internal decision process during task execution, 2. Summarize this trace into a structured "experience" encapsulating the workflow and constraints, and 3. Replay these experiences in subsequent similar tasks to guide the agent's behavior. We detail a multi-level experience abstraction method and a check function mechanism in AgentRR: the former balances experience specificity and generality, while the latter serves as a trust anchor to ensure completeness and safety during replay. In addition, we explore multiple application modes of AgentRR, including user-recorded task demonstration, large-small model collaboration and privacy-aware agent execution, and envision an experience repository for sharing and reusing knowledge to further reduce deployment cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[InfoDeepSeek: Benchmarking Agentic Information Seeking for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15872v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by grounding responses with retrieved information. As an emerging paradigm, Agentic RAG further enhances this process by introducing autonomous LLM agents into the information seeking process. However, existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating such systems, as they are confined to a static retrieval environment with a fixed, limited corpus} and simple queries that fail to elicit agentic behavior. Moreover, their evaluation protocols assess information seeking effectiveness by pre-defined gold sets of documents, making them unsuitable for the open-ended and dynamic nature of real-world web environments. To bridge this gap, we present InfoDeepSeek, a new benchmark with challenging questions designed for assessing agentic information seeking in real-world, dynamic web environments. We propose a systematic methodology for constructing challenging queries satisfying the criteria of determinacy, difficulty, and diversity. Based on this, we develop the first evaluation framework tailored to dynamic agentic information seeking, including fine-grained metrics about the accuracy, utility, and compactness of information seeking outcomes. Through extensive experiments across LLMs, search engines, and question types, InfoDeepSeek reveals nuanced agent behaviors and offers actionable insights for future research.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce IDA-Bench, a novel benchmark evaluating LLM agents in multi-round interactive scenarios. Derived from complex Kaggle notebooks, tasks are presented as sequential natural language instructions by an LLM-simulated user. Agent performance is judged by comparing its final numerical output to the human-derived baseline. Initial results show that even state-of-the-art coding agents (like Claude-3.7-thinking) succeed on < 50% of the tasks, highlighting limitations not evident in single-turn tests. This work underscores the need to improve LLMs' multi-round capabilities for building more reliable data analysis agents, highlighting the necessity of achieving a balance between instruction following and reasoning.</p></details> |  |

By constructing thousands of LLM Agents equipped with modules for personal characteristics, prior expectations, and knowledge, we replicate a survey experiment involving households and experts on inflation and unemployment. Our results show that although the expectations and thoughts generated by LLM Agents are more homogeneous than those of human participants, they still effectively capture key heterogeneity across agents and the underlying drivers of expectation formation. Furthermore, a module-ablation exercise highlights the critical role of prior expectations in simulating such heterogeneity. This approach complements traditional survey methods and offers new insights into AI behavioral science in macroeconomic research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distilling LLM Agent into Small Models with Retrieval and Code Tools](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17612v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks but remain computationally expensive, limiting their practical deployment. To address this, recent works have focused on distilling reasoning capabilities into smaller language models (sLMs) using chain-of-thought (CoT) traces from teacher LLMs. However, this approach struggles in scenarios requiring rare factual knowledge or precise computation, where sLMs often hallucinate due to limited capability. In this work, we propose Agent Distillation, a framework for transferring not only reasoning capability but full task-solving behavior from LLM-based agents into sLMs with retrieval and code tools. We improve agent distillation along two complementary axes: (1) we introduce a prompting method called first-thought prefix to enhance the quality of teacher-generated trajectories; and (2) we propose a self-consistent action generation for improving test-time robustness of small agents. We evaluate our method on eight reasoning tasks across factual and mathematical domains, covering both in-domain and out-of-domain generalization. Our results show that sLMs as small as 0.5B, 1.5B, 3B parameters can achieve performance competitive with next-tier larger 1.5B, 3B, 7B models fine-tuned using CoT distillation, demonstrating the potential of agent distillation for building practical, tool-using small agents. Our code is available at https://github.com/Nardien/agent-distillation.</p></details> | preprint, v1 |
| **[TwinMarket: A Scalable Behavioral and Social Simulation for Financial Markets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01506v4)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study of social emergence has long been a central focus in social science. Traditional modeling approaches, such as rule-based Agent-Based Models (ABMs), struggle to capture the diversity and complexity of human behavior, particularly the irrational factors emphasized in behavioral economics. Recently, large language model (LLM) agents have gained traction as simulation tools for modeling human behavior in social science and role-playing applications. Studies suggest that LLMs can account for cognitive biases, emotional fluctuations, and other non-rational influences, enabling more realistic simulations of socio-economic dynamics. In this work, we introduce TwinMarket, a novel multi-agent framework that leverages LLMs to simulate socio-economic systems. Specifically, we examine how individual behaviors, through interactions and feedback mechanisms, give rise to collective dynamics and emergent phenomena. Through experiments in a simulated stock market environment, we demonstrate how individual actions can trigger group behaviors, leading to emergent outcomes such as financial bubbles and recessions. Our approach provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between individual decision-making and collective socio-economic patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[USTBench: Benchmarking and Dissecting Spatiotemporal Reasoning of LLMs as Urban Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17572v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown emerging potential in spatiotemporal reasoning, making them promising candidates for building urban agents that support diverse urban downstream applications. Despite these benefits, existing studies primarily focus on evaluating urban LLM agent on outcome-level metrics (e.g., prediction accuracy, traffic efficiency), offering limited insight into their underlying reasoning processes. As a result, the strengths and limitations of urban LLM agents in spatiotemporal reasoning remain poorly understood. To this end, we introduce USTBench, the first benchmark to evaluate LLMs' spatiotemporal reasoning abilities as urban agents across four decomposed dimensions: spatiotemporal understanding, forecasting, planning, and reflection with feedback. Specifically, USTBench supports five diverse urban decision-making and four spatiotemporal prediction tasks, all running within our constructed interactive city environment UAgentEnv. The benchmark includes 62,466 structured QA pairs for process-level evaluation and standardized end-to-end task assessments, enabling fine-grained diagnostics and broad task-level comparison across diverse urban scenarios. Through extensive evaluation of thirteen leading LLMs, we reveal that although LLMs show promising potential across various urban downstream tasks, they still struggle in long-horizon planning and reflective adaptation in dynamic urban contexts. Notably, recent advanced reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) trained on general logic or mathematical problems do not consistently outperform non-reasoning LLMs. This discrepancy highlights the need for domain-specialized adaptation methods to enhance urban spatiotemporal reasoning. Overall, USTBench provides a foundation to build more adaptive and effective LLM-based urban agents and broad smart city applications.</p></details> |  |

Despite this, in specialized downstream task contexts, reliance solely on tools is insufficient to fully address the complexities of the real world. This particularly restricts the effective deployment of LLMs in fields such as medicine. In this paper, we focus on the downstream tasks of medical calculators, which use standardized tests to assess an individual's health status. We introduce MeNTi, a universal agent architecture for LLMs. MeNTi integrates a specialized medical toolkit and employs meta-tool and nested calling mechanisms to enhance LLM tool utilization. Specifically, it achieves flexible tool selection and nested tool calling to address practical issues faced in intricate medical scenarios, including calculator selection, slot filling, and unit conversion. To assess the capabilities of LLMs for quantitative assessment throughout the clinical process of calculator scenarios, we introduce CalcQA. This benchmark requires LLMs to use medical calculators to perform calculations and assess patient health status. CalcQA is constructed by professional physicians and includes 100 case-calculator pairs, complemented by a toolkit of 281 medical tools. The experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements with our framework. This research paves new directions for applying LLMs in demanding scenarios of medicine.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 2025 main conference.

A critical aspect of this is code reasoning, which involves logical reasoning with formal languages (i.e., programming code). In this paper, we enhance this capability of LLMs by exploring the following question: how can an LLM agent become progressively smarter in code reasoning with each solution it proposes, thereby achieving substantial cumulative improvement? Most existing research takes a static perspective, focusing on isolated problem-solving using frozen LLMs. In contrast, we adopt a cognitive-evolving perspective and propose a novel framework named Meta-Reflection with Cross-Referencing (MARCO) that enables the LLM to evolve dynamically during inference through self-improvement. From the perspective of human cognitive development, we leverage both knowledge accumulation and lesson sharing. In particular, to accumulate knowledge during problem-solving, we propose meta-reflection that reflects on the reasoning paths of the current problem to obtain knowledge and experience for future consideration. Moreover, to effectively utilize the lessons from other agents, we propose cross-referencing that incorporates the solution and feedback from other agents into the current problem-solving process. We conduct experiments across various datasets in code reasoning, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of MARCO.</p></details> |  |

However, existing surround-view perception systems are limited by inefficiencies in unidirectional interaction pattern with human and distortions in overlapping regions exponentially propagating into non-overlapping areas. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ChatStitch, a surround-view human-machine co-perception system capable of unveiling obscured blind spot information through natural language commands integrated with external digital assets. To dismantle the unidirectional interaction bottleneck, ChatStitch implements a cognitively grounded closed-loop interaction multi-agent framework based on Large Language Models. To suppress distortion propagation across overlapping boundaries, ChatStitch proposes SV-UDIS, a surround-view unsupervised deep image stitching method under the non-global-overlapping condition. We conducted extensive experiments on the UDIS-D, MCOV-SLAM open datasets, and our real-world dataset. Specifically, our SV-UDIS method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the UDIS-D dataset for 3, 4, and 5 image stitching tasks, with PSNR improvements of 9\%, 17\%, and 21\%, and SSIM improvements of 8\%, 18\%, and 26\%, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Utilizing a dual-agent framework, LA-RCS generates plans based on user requests, observes the external environment, executes the plans, and modifies the plans as needed to adapt to changes in the external conditions. Additionally, LA-RCS interprets natural language commands by the user and converts them into commands compatible with the robot interface so that the robot can execute tasks and meet user requests properly. During his process, the system autonomously evaluates observation results, provides feedback on the tasks, and executes commands based on real-time environmental monitoring, significantly reducing the need for user intervention in fulfilling requests. We categorized the scenarios that LA-RCS needs to perform into four distinct types and conducted a quantitative assessment of its performance in each scenario. The results showed an average success rate of 90 percent, demonstrating the system capability to fulfill user requests satisfactorily.

We develop a pipeline to facilitate internet-scale training for agents without laborious human annotations. In the first stage, an LLM annotates 150k sites with agentic tasks. In the next stage, LLM agents complete tasks and produce trajectories. In the final stage, an LLM filters trajectories by judging their success. Language models are powerful data curation tools, identifying harmful content with an accuracy of 97%, judging successful trajectories with an accuracy of 82.6%, and producing effective data. We train agents based on Qwen 3 1.7B that are competitive with frontier LLMs as web agents, while being smaller and faster.

This paper envisions causal LLM agents that integrate multimodal data (text, images, genomics, etc.) and perform intervention-based reasoning to infer cause-and-effect. Addressing this requires overcoming key challenges: designing safe, controllable agentic frameworks; developing rigorous benchmarks for causal evaluation; integrating heterogeneous data sources; and synergistically combining LLMs with structured knowledge (KGs) and formal causal inference tools. Such agents could unlock transformative opportunities, including accelerating drug discovery through automated hypothesis generation and simulation, enabling personalized medicine through patient-specific causal models. This research agenda aims to foster interdisciplinary efforts, bridging causal concepts and foundation models to develop reliable AI partners for biomedical progress.</p></details> |  |

However, much of the progress to date has been evaluated on small-scale, synthetic datasets, raising concerns about the practical effectiveness of ML-based solvers in real-world, large-scale CO scenarios. Additionally, many existing CO benchmarks lack sufficient training data, limiting their utility for evaluating data-driven approaches. To address these limitations, we introduce FrontierCO, a comprehensive benchmark that covers eight canonical CO problem types and evaluates 16 representative ML-based solvers--including graph neural networks and large language model (LLM) agents. FrontierCO features challenging instances drawn from industrial applications and frontier CO research, offering both realistic problem difficulty and abundant training data.

Current solutions predominantly rely on proprietary LLM agents, which introduce unpredictability and limit accessibility, raising concerns about data privacy and model customization. This paper investigates whether open-source LLMs can effectively address repository-level tasks without requiring agent-based approaches. We demonstrate this is possible by enabling LLMs to comprehend functions and files within codebases through their semantic information and structural dependencies. To this end, we introduce Code Graph Models (CGMs), which integrate repository code graph structures into the LLM's attention mechanism and map node attributes to the LLM's input space using a specialized adapter. When combined with an agentless graph RAG framework, our approach achieves a 43.00% resolution rate on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark using the open-source Qwen2.5-72B model. This performance ranks first among open weight models, second among methods with open-source systems, and eighth overall, surpassing the previous best open-source model-based method by 12.33%.</p></details> | 31 pages, 9 figures |

Despite widespread industry adoption, existing evaluation methodologies fail to adequately assess tool utilization capabilities within this new paradigm. This paper introduces MCP-RADAR, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLM performance in the MCP framework through a novel five-dimensional approach measuring: answer accuracy, tool selection efficiency, computational resource efficiency, parameter construction accuracy, and execution speed. Unlike conventional benchmarks that rely on subjective human evaluations or binary success metrics, MCP-RADAR employs objective, quantifiable measurements across multiple task domains including software engineering, mathematical reasoning, and general problem-solving. Our evaluations of leading commercial and open-source LLMs reveal distinctive capability profiles with significant trade-offs between accuracy, efficiency, and speed, challenging traditional single-metric performance rankings. Besides, we provide valuable guidance for developers to optimize their tools for maximum model compatibility and effectiveness. While focused on MCP due to its standardized approach, our methodology remains applicable across all LLM agent tool integration frameworks, providing valuable insights for both LLM developers and tool creators to optimize the entire LLM-tool interaction ecosystem. The implementation, configurations, and datasets used in our evaluation are publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MCPRadar-B143.</p></details> |  |
| **[Permissive Information-Flow Analysis for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03055v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly becoming commodity components of larger software systems. This poses natural security and privacy problems: poisoned data retrieved from one component can change the model's behavior and compromise the entire system, including coercing the model to spread confidential data to untrusted components. One promising approach is to tackle this problem at the system level via dynamic information flow (aka taint) tracking. Unfortunately, this approach of propagating the most restrictive input label to the output is too conservative for applications where LLMs operate on inputs retrieved from diverse sources. In this paper, we propose a novel, more permissive approach to propagate information flow labels through LLM queries. The key idea behind our approach is to propagate only the labels of the samples that were influential in generating the model output and to eliminate the labels of unnecessary inputs. We implement and investigate the effectiveness of two variations of this approach, based on (i) prompt-based retrieval augmentation, and (ii) a $k$-nearest-neighbors language model. We compare these with a baseline that uses introspection to predict the output label. Our experimental results in an LLM agent setting show that the permissive label propagator improves over the baseline in more than 85% of the cases, which underscores the practicality of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReviewAgents: Bridging the Gap Between Human and AI-Generated Paper Reviews](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08506v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Academic paper review is a critical yet time-consuming task within the research community. With the increasing volume of academic publications, automating the review process has become a significant challenge. The primary issue lies in generating comprehensive, accurate, and reasoning-consistent review comments that align with human reviewers' judgments. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing ReviewAgents, a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate academic paper reviews. We first introduce a novel dataset, Review-CoT, consisting of 142k review comments, designed for training LLM agents. This dataset emulates the structured reasoning process of human reviewers-summarizing the paper, referencing relevant works, identifying strengths and weaknesses, and generating a review conclusion. Building upon this, we train LLM reviewer agents capable of structured reasoning using a relevant-paper-aware training method. Furthermore, we construct ReviewAgents, a multi-role, multi-LLM agent review framework, to enhance the review comment generation process. Additionally, we propose ReviewBench, a benchmark for evaluating the review comments generated by LLMs. Our experimental results on ReviewBench demonstrate that while existing LLMs exhibit a certain degree of potential for automating the review process, there remains a gap when compared to human-generated reviews. Moreover, our ReviewAgents framework further narrows this gap, outperforming advanced LLMs in generating review comments.</p></details> | Work in progress |

| **[Psychology-driven LLM Agents for Explainable Panic Prediction on Social Media during Sudden Disaster Events](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16455v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>During sudden disaster events, accurately predicting public panic sentiment on social media is crucial for proactive governance and crisis management. Current efforts on this problem face three main challenges: lack of finely annotated data hinders emotion prediction studies, unmodeled risk perception causes prediction inaccuracies, and insufficient interpretability of panic formation mechanisms. We address these issues by proposing a Psychology-driven generative Agent framework (PsychoAgent) for explainable panic prediction based on emotion arousal theory. Specifically, we first construct a fine-grained open panic emotion dataset (namely COPE) via human-large language models (LLMs) collaboration to mitigate semantic bias. Then, we develop a framework integrating cross-domain heterogeneous data grounded in psychological mechanisms to model risk perception and cognitive differences in emotion generation. To enhance interpretability, we design an LLM-based role-playing agent that simulates individual psychological chains through dedicatedly designed prompts. Experimental results on our annotated dataset show that PsychoAgent improves panic emotion prediction performance by 12.6% to 21.7% compared to baseline models. Furthermore, the explainability and generalization of our approach is validated. Crucially, this represents a paradigm shift from opaque "data-driven fitting" to transparent "role-based simulation with mechanistic interpretation" for panic emotion prediction during emergencies. Our implementation is publicly available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PsychoAgent-19DD.</p></details> |  |

For radiologists, creating CT radiology reports is time-consuming and error-prone. A visual question answering (VQA) system that can answer radiologists' questions about some anatomical regions on the CT scan and even automatically generate a radiology report is urgently needed. However, existing VQA systems cannot adequately handle the CT radiology question answering (CTQA) task for: (1) anatomic complexity makes CT images difficult to understand; (2) spatial relationship across hundreds slices is difficult to capture. To address these issues, this paper proposes CT-Agent, a multimodal agentic framework for CTQA. CT-Agent adopts anatomically independent tools to break down the anatomic complexity; furthermore, it efficiently captures the across-slice spatial relationship with a global-local token compression strategy. Experimental results on two 3D chest CT datasets, CT-RATE and RadGenome-ChestCT, verify the superior performance of CT-Agent.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a new LLM-powered Multi-Agent System (LLM-MAS) benchmark, Collab-Overcooked, built on the popular Overcooked-AI game with more applicable and challenging tasks in interactive environments. Collab-Overcooked extends existing benchmarks from two novel perspectives. First, it provides a multi-agent framework supporting diverse tasks and objectives and encourages collaboration through natural language communication. Second, it introduces a spectrum of process-oriented evaluation metrics to assess the fine-grained collaboration capabilities of different LLM agents, a dimension often overlooked in prior work. We conduct extensive experiments over 11 popular LLMs and show that, while the LLMs present a strong ability in goal interpretation, there is a significant discrepancy in active collaboration and continuous adaptation which are critical for efficiently fulfilling complicated tasks. Notably, we highlight the strengths and weaknesses in LLM-MAS and provide insights for improving and evaluating LLM-MAS on a unified and open-sourced benchmark. The environments, 30 open-ended tasks, and the evaluation package are publicly available at https://github.com/YusaeMeow/Collab-Overcooked.</p></details> | 30 pages, 17 figures |
| **[CityEQA: A Hierarchical LLM Agent on Embodied Question Answering Benchmark in City Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12532v3)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied Question Answering (EQA) has primarily focused on indoor environments, leaving the complexities of urban settings-spanning environment, action, and perception-largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce CityEQA, a new task where an embodied agent answers open-vocabulary questions through active exploration in dynamic city spaces. To support this task, we present CityEQA-EC, the first benchmark dataset featuring 1,412 human-annotated tasks across six categories, grounded in a realistic 3D urban simulator. Moreover, we propose Planner-Manager-Actor (PMA), a novel agent tailored for CityEQA. PMA enables long-horizon planning and hierarchical task execution: the Planner breaks down the question answering into sub-tasks, the Manager maintains an object-centric cognitive map for spatial reasoning during the process control, and the specialized Actors handle navigation, exploration, and collection sub-tasks. Experiments demonstrate that PMA achieves 60.7% of human-level answering accuracy, significantly outperforming competitive baselines. While promising, the performance gap compared to humans highlights the need for enhanced visual reasoning in CityEQA. This work paves the way for future advancements in urban spatial intelligence. Dataset and code are available at https://github.com/BiluYong/CityEQA.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Memory Management Impacts LLM Agents: An Empirical Study of Experience-Following Behavior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16067v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Memory is a critical component in large language model (LLM)-based agents, enabling them to store and retrieve past executions to improve task performance over time. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on how memory management choices impact the LLM agents' behavior, especially their long-term performance. Specifically, we focus on two fundamental memory operations that are widely used by many agent frameworks-addition, which incorporates new experiences into the memory base, and deletion, which selectively removes past experiences-to systematically study their impact on the agent behavior. Through our quantitative analysis, we find that LLM agents display an experience-following property: high similarity between a task input and the input in a retrieved memory record often results in highly similar agent outputs. Our analysis further reveals two significant challenges associated with this property: error propagation, where inaccuracies in past experiences compound and degrade future performance, and misaligned experience replay, where outdated or irrelevant experiences negatively influence current tasks. Through controlled experiments, we show that combining selective addition and deletion strategies can help mitigate these negative effects, yielding an average absolute performance gain of 10% compared to naive memory growth. Furthermore, we highlight how memory management choices affect agents' behavior under challenging conditions such as task distribution shifts and constrained memory resources. Our findings offer insights into the behavioral dynamics of LLM agent memory systems and provide practical guidance for designing memory components that support robust, long-term agent performance. We also release our code to facilitate further study.</p></details> |  |
| **[CRAKEN: Cybersecurity LLM Agent with Knowledge-Based Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17107v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents can automate cybersecurity tasks and can adapt to the evolving cybersecurity landscape without re-engineering. While LLM agents have demonstrated cybersecurity capabilities on Capture-The-Flag (CTF) competitions, they have two key limitations: accessing latest cybersecurity expertise beyond training data, and integrating new knowledge into complex task planning. Knowledge-based approaches that incorporate technical understanding into the task-solving automation can tackle these limitations. We present CRAKEN, a knowledge-based LLM agent framework that improves cybersecurity capability through three core mechanisms: contextual decomposition of task-critical information, iterative self-reflected knowledge retrieval, and knowledge-hint injection that transforms insights into adaptive attack strategies. Comprehensive evaluations with different configurations show CRAKEN's effectiveness in multi-stage vulnerability detection and exploitation compared to previous approaches. Our extensible architecture establishes new methodologies for embedding new security knowledge into LLM-driven cybersecurity agentic systems. With a knowledge database of CTF writeups, CRAKEN obtained an accuracy of 22% on NYU CTF Bench, outperforming prior works by 3% and achieving state-of-the-art results. On evaluation of MITRE ATT&CK techniques, CRAKEN solves 25-30% more techniques than prior work, demonstrating improved cybersecurity capabilities via knowledge-based execution. We make our framework open source to public https://github.com/NYU-LLM-CTF/nyuctf_agents_craken.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReflAct: World-Grounded Decision Making in LLM Agents via Goal-State Reflection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15182v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in LLM agents have largely built on reasoning backbones like ReAct, which interleave thought and action in complex environments. However, ReAct often produces ungrounded or incoherent reasoning steps, leading to misalignment between the agent's actual state and goal. Our analysis finds that this stems from ReAct's inability to maintain consistent internal beliefs and goal alignment, causing compounding errors and hallucinations. To address this, we introduce ReflAct, a novel backbone that shifts reasoning from merely planning next actions to continuously reflecting on the agent's state relative to its goal. By explicitly grounding decisions in states and enforcing ongoing goal alignment, ReflAct dramatically improves strategic reliability. This design delivers substantial empirical gains: ReflAct surpasses ReAct by 27.7% on average, achieving a 93.3% success rate in ALFWorld. Notably, ReflAct even outperforms ReAct with added enhancement modules (e.g., Reflexion, WKM), showing that strengthening the core reasoning backbone is key to reliable agent performance.</p></details> |  |

We study the major challenges in using popular video games to evaluate modern LLMs and find that directly dropping LLMs into games cannot make an effective evaluation, for three reasons -- brittle vision perception, prompt sensitivity, and potential data contamination. We introduce lmgame-Bench to turn games into reliable evaluations. lmgame-Bench features a suite of platformer, puzzle, and narrative games delivered through a unified Gym-style API and paired with lightweight perception and memory scaffolds, and is designed to stabilize prompt variance and remove contamination. Across 13 leading models, we show lmgame-Bench is challenging while still separating models well. Correlation analysis shows that every game probes a unique blend of capabilities often tested in isolation elsewhere. More interestingly, performing reinforcement learning on a single game from lmgame-Bench transfers both to unseen games and to external planning tasks. Our evaluation code is available at https://github.com/lmgame-org/GamingAgent/lmgame-bench.</p></details> |  |

| **[Disentangling Reasoning and Knowledge in Medical Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11462v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) aims to emulate clinicians' diagnostic thinking, but current benchmarks such as MedQA-USMLE, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA often mix reasoning with factual recall. We address this by separating 11 biomedical QA benchmarks into reasoning- and knowledge-focused subsets using a PubMedBERT classifier that reaches 81 percent accuracy, comparable to human performance. Our analysis shows that only 32.8 percent of questions require complex reasoning. We evaluate biomedical models (HuatuoGPT-o1, MedReason, m1) and general-domain models (DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini, Qwen3), finding consistent gaps between knowledge and reasoning performance. For example, m1 scores 60.5 on knowledge but only 47.1 on reasoning. In adversarial tests where models are misled with incorrect initial reasoning, biomedical models degrade sharply, while larger or RL-trained general models show more robustness. To address this, we train BioMed-R1 using fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on reasoning-heavy examples. It achieves the strongest performance among similarly sized models. Further gains may come from incorporating clinical case reports and training with adversarial and backtracking scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Among these, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has garnered significant attention due to its features of rapid deployment and privacy protection. However, existing medical RAG frameworks still have shortcomings. Most existing medical RAG frameworks are designed for single-round question answering tasks and are not suitable for multi-round diagnostic dialogue. On the other hand, existing medical multi-round RAG frameworks do not consider the interconnections between potential diseases to inquire precisely like a doctor. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Round Diagnostic RAG (MRD-RAG) framework that mimics the doctor's diagnostic process. This RAG framework can analyze diagnosis information of potential diseases and accurately conduct multi-round diagnosis like a doctor. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed frameworks, we conduct experiments on two modern medical datasets and two traditional Chinese medicine datasets, with evaluations by GPT and human doctors on different methods. The results indicate that our RAG framework can significantly enhance the diagnostic performance of LLMs, highlighting the potential of our approach in medical diagnosis. The code and data can be found in our project website https://github.com/YixiangCh/MRD-RAG/tree/master.</p></details> |  |

It combines real-world clinical ECG data with systematically generated synthetic cases, covering 12 essential diagnostic tasks and totaling 47,211 expert-validated QA pairs. These encompass diverse clinical scenarios, from basic rhythm recognition to complex diagnoses involving rare conditions and temporal changes. A key innovation is the support for multi-turn dialogues, enabling the development of conversational medical AI systems that emulate clinician-patient or interprofessional interactions. This allows for more realistic assessment of AI models' clinical reasoning, diagnostic accuracy, and knowledge integration. Constructed through a knowledge-guided framework with strict quality control, ECG-Expert-QA ensures linguistic and clinical consistency, making it a high-quality resource for advancing AI-assisted ECG interpretation. It challenges models with tasks like identifying subtle ischemic changes and interpreting complex arrhythmias in context-rich scenarios. To promote research transparency and collaboration, the dataset, accompanying code, and prompts are publicly released at https://github.com/Zaozzz/ECG-Expert-QA</p></details> |  |

The rise of assistive technologies like ambient dictation, which automatically generates draft notes from live patient encounters, has the potential to introduce additional noise making it crucial to assess the ability of LLM's to filter relevant data. To investigate this, we developed MedDistractQA, a benchmark using USMLE-style questions embedded with simulated real-world distractions. Our findings show that distracting statements (polysemous words with clinical meanings used in a non-clinical context or references to unrelated health conditions) can reduce LLM accuracy by up to 17.9%. Commonly proposed solutions to improve model performance such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and medical fine-tuning did not change this effect and in some cases introduced their own confounders and further degraded performance. Our findings suggest that LLMs natively lack the logical mechanisms necessary to distinguish relevant from irrelevant clinical information, posing challenges for real-world applications. MedDistractQA and our results highlights the need for robust mitigation strategies to enhance LLM resilience to extraneous information.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 2 main figures, 6 extended figures</p></details> |

Moreover, these LLMs typically have several billions of parameters, making them computationally expensive for healthcare systems. Thus, in this study, we propose CancerLLM, a model with 7 billion parameters and a Mistral-style architecture, pre-trained on nearly 2.7M clinical notes and over 515K pathology reports covering 17 cancer types, followed by fine-tuning on two cancer-relevant tasks, including cancer phenotypes extraction and cancer diagnosis generation. Our evaluation demonstrated that the CancerLLM achieves state-of-the-art results with F1 score of 91.78% on phenotyping extraction and 86.81% on disganois generation. It outperformed existing LLMs, with an average F1 score improvement of 9.23%. Additionally, the CancerLLM demonstrated its efficiency on time and GPU usage, and robustness comparing with other LLMs. We demonstrated that CancerLLM can potentially provide an effective and robust solution to advance clinical research and practice in cancer domain</p></details> | <details><summary>new v...</summary><p>new version, add the RAG version of cancerLLM</p></details> |

This paper introduces MedHallBench, a comprehensive benchmark framework for evaluating and mitigating hallucinations in MLLMs. Our methodology integrates expert-validated medical case scenarios with established medical databases to create a robust evaluation dataset. The framework employs a sophisticated measurement system that combines automated ACHMI (Automatic Caption Hallucination Measurement in Medical Imaging) scoring with rigorous clinical expert evaluations and utilizes reinforcement learning methods to achieve automatic annotation. Through an optimized reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) training pipeline specifically designed for medical applications, MedHallBench enables thorough evaluation of MLLMs across diverse clinical contexts while maintaining stringent accuracy standards. We conducted comparative experiments involving various models, utilizing the benchmark to establish a baseline for widely adopted large language models (LLMs). Our findings indicate that ACHMI provides a more nuanced understanding of the effects of hallucinations compared to traditional metrics, thereby highlighting its advantages in hallucination assessment. This research establishes a foundational framework for enhancing MLLMs' reliability in healthcare settings and presents actionable strategies for addressing the critical challenge of AI hallucinations in medical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published to AAAI-25 Bridge Program</p></details> |
| **[Medical Large Language Model Benchmarks Should Prioritize Construct Validity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10694v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical large language models (LLMs) research often makes bold claims, from encoding clinical knowledge to reasoning like a physician. These claims are usually backed by evaluation on competitive benchmarks; a tradition inherited from mainstream machine learning. But how do we separate real progress from a leaderboard flex? Medical LLM benchmarks, much like those in other fields, are arbitrarily constructed using medical licensing exam questions. For these benchmarks to truly measure progress, they must accurately capture the real-world tasks they aim to represent. In this position paper, we argue that medical LLM benchmarks should (and indeed can) be empirically evaluated for their construct validity. In the psychological testing literature, "construct validity" refers to the ability of a test to measure an underlying "construct", that is the actual conceptual target of evaluation. By drawing an analogy between LLM benchmarks and psychological tests, we explain how frameworks from this field can provide empirical foundations for validating benchmarks. To put these ideas into practice, we use real-world clinical data in proof-of-concept experiments to evaluate popular medical LLM benchmarks and report significant gaps in their construct validity. Finally, we outline a vision for a new ecosystem of medical LLM evaluation centered around the creation of valid benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Chinese Medical LLMs: A Medbench-based Analysis of Performance Gaps and Hierarchical Optimization Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07306v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evaluation and improvement of medical large language models (LLMs) are critical for their real-world deployment, particularly in ensuring accuracy, safety, and ethical alignment. Existing frameworks inadequately dissect domain-specific error patterns or address cross-modal challenges. This study introduces a granular error taxonomy through systematic analysis of top 10 models on MedBench, categorizing incorrect responses into eight types: Omissions, Hallucination, Format Mismatch, Causal Reasoning Deficiency, Contextual Inconsistency, Unanswered, Output Error, and Deficiency in Medical Language Generation. Evaluation of 10 leading models reveals vulnerabilities: despite achieving 0.86 accuracy in medical knowledge recall, critical reasoning tasks show 96.3% omission, while safety ethics evaluations expose alarming inconsistency (robustness score: 0.79) under option shuffled. Our analysis uncovers systemic weaknesses in knowledge boundary enforcement and multi-step reasoning. To address these, we propose a tiered optimization strategy spanning four levels, from prompt engineering and knowledge-augmented retrieval to hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures and causal reasoning frameworks. This work establishes an actionable roadmap for developing clinically robust LLMs while redefining evaluation paradigms through error-driven insights, ultimately advancing the safety and trustworthiness of AI in high-stakes medical environments.</p></details> |  |

While deep learning (DL) shows promise in LDCT reconstruction, it requires large-scale data collection from multiple clients, raising privacy concerns. Federated learning (FL) has been introduced to address these privacy concerns; however, current methods are typically tailored to specific scanning protocols, which limits their generalizability and makes them less effective for unseen protocols. To address these issues, we propose SCAN-PhysFed, a novel SCanning- and ANatomy-level personalized Physics-Driven Federated learning paradigm for LDCT reconstruction. Since the noise distribution in LDCT data is closely tied to scanning protocols and anatomical structures being scanned, we design a dual-level physics-informed way to address these challenges. Specifically, we incorporate physical and anatomical prompts into our physics-informed hypernetworks to capture scanning- and anatomy-specific information, enabling dual-level physics-driven personalization of imaging features. These prompts are derived from the scanning protocol and the radiology report generated by a medical large language model (MLLM), respectively. Subsequently, client-specific decoders project these dual-level personalized imaging features back into the image domain. Besides, to tackle the challenge of unseen data, we introduce a novel protocol vector-quantization strategy (PVQS), which ensures consistent performance across new clients by quantifying the unseen scanning code as one of the codes in the scanning codebook. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of SCAN-PhysFed on public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Efficiently Democratizing Medical LLMs for 50 Languages via a Mixture of Language Family Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10626v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapting medical Large Language Models to local languages can reduce barriers to accessing healthcare services, but data scarcity remains a significant challenge, particularly for low-resource languages. To address this, we first construct a high-quality medical dataset and conduct analysis to ensure its quality. In order to leverage the generalization capability of multilingual LLMs to efficiently scale to more resource-constrained languages, we explore the internal information flow of LLMs from a multilingual perspective using Mixture of Experts (MoE) modularity. Technically, we propose a novel MoE routing method that employs language-specific experts and cross-lingual routing. Inspired by circuit theory, our routing analysis revealed a Spread Out in the End information flow mechanism: while earlier layers concentrate cross-lingual information flow, the later layers exhibit language-specific divergence. This insight directly led to the development of the Post-MoE architecture, which applies sparse routing only in the later layers while maintaining dense others. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach enhances the generalization of multilingual models to other languages while preserving interpretability. Finally, to efficiently scale the model to 50 languages, we introduce the concept of language family experts, drawing on linguistic priors, which enables scaling the number of languages without adding additional parameters.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose the Incremental Curriculum-Based Fine-Tuning (ICFT) framework to enhance the generative capabilities of medical large language models (MLLMs). ICFT combines curriculum-based learning, dual-stage memory coordination, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning to enable a progressive transition from general linguistic knowledge to strong domain-specific expertise. Experimental results across diverse medical NLP tasks, including question answering, preference classification, and response generation, demonstrate that ICFT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving improvements in both accuracy and efficiency. Further analysis reveals the framework's ability to generalize to unseen data, reduce errors, and deliver diverse, contextually relevant medical responses. These findings establish ICFT as a robust and scalable solution for adapting LLMs to the medical domain, offering practical benefits for real-world healthcare applications.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging the inherent advantages of federated learning, such as preserving data privacy and enabling distributed computation, this research explores the integration of RAG systems with models trained under varying client configurations to optimize performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the federated learning-based models integrated with RAG systems consistently outperform their non-integrated counterparts across all evaluation metrics. This study highlights the potential of combining federated learning and RAG systems for developing domain-specific LLMs in the medical field, providing a scalable and privacy-preserving solution for enhancing text generation capabilities.</p></details> |  |

We emphasise the importance of understanding reasoning behaviour as opposed to high-level prediction accuracies, since it is equivalent to explainable AI (XAI) in this context. In particular, achieving XAI in medical LLMs used in the clinical domain will have a significant impact across the healthcare sector. Results: Therefore, we define the concept of reasoning behaviour in the specific context of medical LLMs. We then categorise and discuss the current state of the art of methods which evaluate reasoning behaviour in medical LLMs. Finally, we propose theoretical frameworks which can empower medical professionals or machine learning engineers to gain insight into the low-level reasoning operations of these previously obscure models. Conclusion: The subsequent increased transparency and trust in medical machine learning models by clinicians as well as patients will accelerate the integration, application as well as further development of medical AI for the healthcare system as a whole</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables.

Considering this rapid technical progress, in this survey, we trace the recent advances of Medical Large Language Models (Med-LLMs), including the background, key findings, and mainstream techniques, especially for the evolution from general-purpose models to medical-specialized applications. Firstly, we delve into the foundational technology of Med-LLMs, indicating how general models can be progressively adapted and refined for the complicated medical tasks. Secondly, the wide-ranging applications of Med-LLMs are investigated across various healthcare domains, as well as an up-to-date review of existing Med-LLMs. The transformative impact of these models on daily medical practice is evident through their ability to assist clinicians, educators, and patients. Recognizing the importance of responsible innovation, we discuss the challenges associated with ensuring fairness, accountability, privacy, and robustness. Ethical considerations, rigorous evaluation methodologies, and the establishment of regulatory frameworks are crucial for building trustworthiness in the real-world system. We emphasize the need for ongoing scrutiny and development to maintain high standards of safety and reliability. Finally, we anticipate possible future trajectories for Med-LLMs, identifying key avenues for prudent expansion. By consolidating these insights, our review aims to provide professionals and researchers with a thorough understanding of the strengths and limitations of Med-LLMs, fostering a balanced and ethical approach to their integration into the healthcare ecosystem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Foundation Models for Critical Care Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16346v1)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Notable progress has been made in generalist medical large language models across various healthcare areas. However, large-scale modeling of in-hospital time series data - such as vital signs, lab results, and treatments in critical care - remains underexplored. Existing datasets are relatively small, but combining them can enhance patient diversity and improve model robustness. To effectively utilize these combined datasets for large-scale modeling, it is essential to address the distribution shifts caused by varying treatment policies, necessitating the harmonization of treatment variables across the different datasets. This work aims to establish a foundation for training large-scale multi-variate time series models on critical care data and to provide a benchmark for machine learning models in transfer learning across hospitals to study and address distribution shift challenges. We introduce a harmonized dataset for sequence modeling and transfer learning research, representing the first large-scale collection to include core treatment variables. Future plans involve expanding this dataset to support further advancements in transfer learning and the development of scalable, generalizable models for critical healthcare applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Oral Presentation at AIM-FM Workshop at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Leveraging their generative capabilities has the potential to enhance the level and quality of medical services. In response to the limitations of current large language models, which often struggle with accuracy and have narrow capabilities in medical applications, this paper presents a Chinese medical large language model, MedGo. MedGo was trained using a combination of high quality unsupervised medical data, supervised data, and preference alignment data, aimed at enhancing both its versatility and precision in medical tasks. The model was evaluated through the public CBLUE benchmark and a manually constructed dataset ClinicalQA. The results demonstrate that MedGo achieved promising performance across various Chinese medical information processing tasks, achieved the first place in the CBLUE evaluation. Additionally, on our constructed dataset ClinicalQA, MedGo outperformed its base model Qwen2, highlighting its potential to improve both automated medical question answering and clinical decision support. These experimental results demonstrate that MedGo possesses strong information processing capabilities in the medical field. At present, we have successfully deployed MedGo at Shanghai East Hospital.</p></details> | 12 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Medical Graph RAG: Towards Safe Medical Large Language Model via Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04187v2)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework specifically designed for the medical domain, called \textbf{MedGraphRAG}, aimed at enhancing Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities for generating evidence-based medical responses, thereby improving safety and reliability when handling private medical data. Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) leverages LLMs to organize RAG data into graphs, showing strong potential for gaining holistic insights from long-form documents. However, its standard implementation is overly complex for general use and lacks the ability to generate evidence-based responses, limiting its effectiveness in the medical field. To extend the capabilities of GraphRAG to the medical domain, we propose unique Triple Graph Construction and U-Retrieval techniques over it. In our graph construction, we create a triple-linked structure that connects user documents to credible medical sources and controlled vocabularies. In the retrieval process, we propose U-Retrieval which combines Top-down Precise Retrieval with Bottom-up Response Refinement to balance global context awareness with precise indexing. These effort enable both source information retrieval and comprehensive response generation. Our approach is validated on 9 medical Q\&A benchmarks, 2 health fact-checking benchmarks, and one collected dataset testing long-form generation.

We present CliMedBench, a comprehensive benchmark with 14 expert-guided core clinical scenarios specifically designed to assess the medical ability of LLMs across 7 pivot dimensions. It comprises 33,735 questions derived from real-world medical reports of top-tier tertiary hospitals and authentic examination exercises. The reliability of this benchmark has been confirmed in several ways. Subsequent experiments with existing LLMs have led to the following findings: (i) Chinese medical LLMs underperform on this benchmark, especially where medical reasoning and factual consistency are vital, underscoring the need for advances in clinical knowledge and diagnostic accuracy. (ii) Several general-domain LLMs demonstrate substantial potential in medical clinics, while the limited input capacity of many medical LLMs hinders their practical use. These findings reveal both the strengths and limitations of LLMs in clinical scenarios and offer critical insights for medical research.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ENMLP-2024</p></details> |
| **[Editing Factual Knowledge and Explanatory Ability of Medical Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18099v3)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model editing aims to precisely alter the behaviors of large language models (LLMs) in relation to specific knowledge, while leaving unrelated knowledge intact. This approach has proven effective in addressing issues of hallucination and outdated information in LLMs. However, the potential of using model editing to modify knowledge in the medical field remains largely unexplored, even though resolving hallucination is a pressing need in this area. Our observations indicate that current methods face significant challenges in dealing with specialized and complex knowledge in medical domain. Therefore, we propose MedLaSA, a novel Layer-wise Scalable Adapter strategy for medical model editing. MedLaSA harnesses the strengths of both adding extra parameters and locate-then-edit methods for medical model editing. We utilize causal tracing to identify the association of knowledge in neurons across different layers, and generate a corresponding scale set from the association value for each piece of knowledge. Subsequently, we incorporate scalable adapters into the dense layers of LLMs. These adapters are assigned scaling values based on the corresponding specific knowledge, which allows for the adjustment of the adapter's weight and rank. The more similar the content, the more consistent the scale between them. This ensures precise editing of semantically identical knowledge while avoiding impact on unrelated knowledge. To evaluate the editing impact on the behaviours of LLMs, we propose two model editing studies for medical domain: (1) editing factual knowledge for medical specialization and (2) editing the explanatory ability for complex knowledge. We build two novel medical benchmarking datasets and introduce a series of challenging and comprehensive metrics. Extensive experiments on medical LLMs demonstrate the editing efficiency of MedLaSA, without affecting unrelated knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2024</p></details> |

Particularly in the healthcare industry, there is an increasing demand for locally operated LLMs due to security concerns. However, the majority of high quality open-source LLMs have a size of 70B parameters, imposing significant financial burdens on users for GPU preparation and operation. To overcome these issues, we present a medical adaptation based on the recent 7B models, which enables the operation in low computational resources. We compare the performance on medical question-answering benchmarks in two languages (Japanese and English), demonstrating that its scores reach parity with or surpass those of currently existing medical LLMs that are ten times larger. We find that fine-tuning an English-centric base model on Japanese medical dataset improves the score in both language, supporting the effect of cross-lingual knowledge transfer. We hope that this study will alleviate financial challenges, serving as a stepping stone for clinical institutions to practically utilize LLMs locally.

Adapting generic LLMs for healthcare often requires continual pretraining, but this approach is computationally expensive and sometimes impractical. Instruction fine-tuning on a specific task may not always guarantee optimal performance due to the lack of broader domain knowledge that the model needs to understand and reason effectively in diverse scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce two multilingual instruction fine-tuning datasets, MMed-IFT and MMed-IFT-MC, containing over 200k high-quality medical samples in six languages. We propose a two-stage training paradigm: the first stage injects general medical knowledge using MMed-IFT, while the second stage fine-tunes task-specific multiple-choice questions with MMed-IFT-MC. Our method achieves competitive results on both English and multilingual benchmarks, striking a balance between computational efficiency and performance.

With big data, especially texts, forming the foundation of medical services, there is an exigent need for effective natural language processing (NLP) solutions tailored to the healthcare domain. Conventional approaches leveraging pre-trained models present promising results in this domain and current large language models (LLMs) offer advanced foundation for medical text processing. However, most medical LLMs are trained only with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), even though it efficiently empowers LLMs to understand and respond to medical instructions but is ineffective in learning domain knowledge and aligning with human preference. In this work, we propose ChiMed-GPT, a new benchmark LLM designed explicitly for Chinese medical domain, and undergoes a comprehensive training regime with pre-training, SFT, and RLHF. Evaluations on tasks including information extraction, question answering, and dialogue generation demonstrate ChiMed-GPT's superior performance over general domain LLMs. Furthermore, we analyze possible biases through prompting ChiMed-GPT to perform attitude scales regarding discrimination of patients, so as to contribute to further responsible development of LLMs in the medical domain.

Pre-training LLMs from scratch for domains like medicine is resource-heavy and often unfeasible. On the other hand, sole reliance on Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) can result in overconfident predictions and may not tap into domain-specific insights. In response, we present a multi-stage training method combining Domain-specific Continued Pre-training (DCPT), SFT, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In addition, we publish a 3Gb Chinese Medicine (ChiMed) dataset, encompassing medical question answering, plain texts, knowledge graphs, and dialogues, segmented into three training stages. The medical LLM trained with our pipeline, Qilin-Med, shows substantial performance improvement. In the CPT and SFT phases, Qilin-Med achieved 38.4% and 40.0% accuracy on the CMExam test set, respectively. It outperformed the basemodel Baichuan-7B (accuracy: 33.5%), by 7.5%. In the DPO phase, it scored 16.66 in BLEU-1 and 27.44 in ROUGE-1 on the Huatuo-26M test set, bringing further improvement to the SFT phase (12.69 in BLEU-1 and 24.21 in ROUGE-1). Additionally, we have further enhanced the model's performance through the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. Experiments demonstrate that Qilin-Med-RAG achieves an accuracy rate of 42.8% on CMExam.

Despite advancements, challenges persist due to the complexity and diversity inherent in medical tasks which often require multi-task learning capabilities. Previous approaches, although beneficial, fall short in real-world applications because they necessitate task-specific annotations at inference time, limiting broader generalization. This paper introduces MING-MOE, a novel Mixture-of-Expert~(MOE)-based medical large language model designed to manage diverse and complex medical tasks without requiring task-specific annotations, thus enhancing its usability across extensive datasets. MING-MOE employs a Mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation (MoLoRA) technique, allowing for efficient parameter usage by maintaining base model parameters static while adapting through a minimal set of trainable parameters. We demonstrate that MING-MOE achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on over 20 medical tasks, illustrating a significant improvement over existing models. This approach not only extends the capabilities of medical language models but also improves inference efficiency.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |

However, most existing research focuses on general medicine, and there is a need for in-depth study of LLMs in specific fields like anesthesiology. To fill the gap, we introduce Hypnos, a Chinese Anesthesia model built upon existing LLMs, e.g., Llama. Hypnos' contributions have three aspects: 1) The data, such as utilizing Self-Instruct, acquired from current LLMs likely includes inaccuracies. Hypnos implements a cross-filtering strategy to improve the data quality. This strategy involves using one LLM to assess the quality of the generated data from another LLM and filtering out the data with low quality. 2) Hypnos employs a general-to-specific training strategy that starts by fine-tuning LLMs using the general medicine data and subsequently improving the fine-tuned LLMs using data specifically from Anesthesiology. The general medical data supplement the medical expertise in Anesthesiology and enhance the effectiveness of Hypnos' generation. 3) We introduce a standardized benchmark for evaluating medical LLM in Anesthesiology. Our benchmark includes both publicly available instances from the Internet and privately obtained cases from the Hospital. Hypnos outperforms other medical LLMs in anesthesiology in metrics, GPT-4, and human evaluation on the benchmark dataset.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we introduce MedBench, a comprehensive benchmark for the Chinese medical domain, comprising 40,041 questions sourced from authentic examination exercises and medical reports of diverse branches of medicine. In particular, this benchmark is composed of four key components: the Chinese Medical Licensing Examination, the Resident Standardization Training Examination, the Doctor In-Charge Qualification Examination, and real-world clinic cases encompassing examinations, diagnoses, and treatments. MedBench replicates the educational progression and clinical practice experiences of doctors in Mainland China, thereby establishing itself as a credible benchmark for assessing the mastery of knowledge and reasoning abilities in medical language learning models. We perform extensive experiments and conduct an in-depth analysis from diverse perspectives, which culminate in the following findings: (1) Chinese medical LLMs underperform on this benchmark, highlighting the need for significant advances in clinical knowledge and diagnostic precision. (2) Several general-domain LLMs surprisingly possess considerable medical knowledge.

In this paper, we introduce Argus to address these limitations with a new visual attention grounding mechanism. Our approach employs object-centric grounding as visual chain-of-thought signals, enabling more effective goal-conditioned visual attention during multimodal reasoning tasks. Evaluations on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Argus excels in both multimodal reasoning tasks and referring object grounding tasks. Extensive analysis further validates various design choices of Argus, and reveals the effectiveness of explicit language-guided visual region-of-interest engagement in MLLMs, highlighting the importance of advancing multimodal intelligence from a visual-centric perspective.

Such datasets offer a powerful lens into societal interests, trending topics, and collective concerns. Yet, existing approaches typically treat these interactions as independent and miss critical insights that could emerge from aggregating and reasoning across large-scale conversation logs. In this paper, we introduce Aggregative Question Answering, a novel task requiring models to reason explicitly over thousands of user-chatbot interactions to answer aggregative queries, such as identifying emerging concerns among specific demographics. To enable research in this direction, we construct a benchmark, WildChat-AQA, comprising 6,027 aggregative questions derived from 182,330 real-world chatbot conversations. Experiments show that existing methods either struggle to reason effectively or incur prohibitive computational costs, underscoring the need for new approaches capable of extracting collective insights from large-scale conversational data.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks, however, probe only single-image relations and thus fail to assess the multi-image spatial reasoning that real-world deployments demand. We introduce MMSI-Bench, a VQA benchmark dedicated to multi-image spatial intelligence. Six 3D-vision researchers spent more than 300 hours meticulously crafting 1,000 challenging, unambiguous multiple-choice questions from over 120,000 images, each paired with carefully designed distractors and a step-by-step reasoning process. We conduct extensive experiments and thoroughly evaluate 34 open-source and proprietary MLLMs, observing a wide gap: the strongest open-source model attains roughly 30% accuracy and OpenAI's o3 reasoning model reaches 40%, while humans score 97%. These results underscore the challenging nature of MMSI-Bench and the substantial headroom for future research. Leveraging the annotated reasoning processes, we also provide an automated error analysis pipeline that diagnoses four dominant failure modes, including (1) grounding errors, (2) overlap-matching and scene-reconstruction errors, (3) situation-transformation reasoning errors, and (4) spatial-logic errors, offering valuable insights for advancing multi-image spatial intelligence.

However, traditional automated theorem proving (ATP) approaches rely heavily on formal proof systems that poorly align with LLMs' strength derived from informal, natural language knowledge acquired during pre-training. In this work, we propose DeepTheorem, a comprehensive informal theorem-proving framework exploiting natural language to enhance LLM mathematical reasoning. DeepTheorem includes a large-scale benchmark dataset consisting of 121K high-quality IMO-level informal theorems and proofs spanning diverse mathematical domains, rigorously annotated for correctness, difficulty, and topic categories, accompanied by systematically constructed verifiable theorem variants. We devise a novel reinforcement learning strategy (RL-Zero) explicitly tailored to informal theorem proving, leveraging the verified theorem variants to incentivize robust mathematical inference. Additionally, we propose comprehensive outcome and process evaluation metrics examining proof correctness and the quality of reasoning steps. Extensive experimental analyses demonstrate DeepTheorem significantly improves LLM theorem-proving performance compared to existing datasets and supervised fine-tuning protocols, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and reasoning quality. Our findings highlight DeepTheorem's potential to fundamentally advance automated informal theorem proving and mathematical exploration.</p></details> |  |

However, existing evaluations often focus on general-purpose or multimodal scenarios, leaving a gap in domain-specific benchmarks that assess tool-use capabilities in complex remote sensing use cases. We present ThinkGeo, an agentic benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-driven agents on remote sensing tasks via structured tool use and multi-step planning. Inspired by tool-interaction paradigms, ThinkGeo includes human-curated queries spanning a wide range of real-world applications such as urban planning, disaster assessment and change analysis, environmental monitoring, transportation analysis, aviation monitoring, recreational infrastructure, and industrial site analysis. Each query is grounded in satellite or aerial imagery and requires agents to reason through a diverse toolset. We implement a ReAct-style interaction loop and evaluate both open and closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Qwen2.5) on 436 structured agentic tasks. The benchmark reports both step-wise execution metrics and final answer correctness. Our analysis reveals notable disparities in tool accuracy and planning consistency across models.

State-of-the-art alignment methods (such as PPO-based RLHF and DPO) are built on the assumption of aligning with a single preference model, despite being deployed in settings where users have diverse preferences. As a result, it is not even clear that these alignment methods produce models that satisfy users on average -- a minimal requirement for pluralistic alignment. Drawing on social choice theory and modeling users' comparisons through individual Bradley-Terry (BT) models, we introduce an alignment method's distortion: the worst-case ratio between the optimal achievable average utility, and the average utility of the learned policy. The notion of distortion helps draw sharp distinctions between alignment methods: Nash Learning from Human Feedback achieves the minimax optimal distortion of $(\frac{1}{2} + o(1)) \cdot \beta$ (for the BT temperature $\beta$), robustly across utility distributions, distributions of comparison pairs, and permissible KL divergences from the reference policy. RLHF and DPO, by contrast, suffer $\geq (1 - o(1)) \cdot \beta$ distortion already without a KL constraint, and $e^{\Omega(\beta)}$ or even unbounded distortion in the full setting, depending on how comparison pairs are sampled.</p></details> |  |

However, improving their spatial intelligence remains a challenge. Existing 3D MLLMs always rely on additional 3D or 2.5D data to incorporate spatial awareness, restricting their utility in scenarios with only 2D inputs, such as images or videos. In this paper, we present Spatial-MLLM, a novel framework for visual-based spatial reasoning from purely 2D observations. Unlike conventional video MLLMs which rely on CLIP-based visual encoders optimized for semantic understanding, our key insight is to unleash the strong structure prior from the feed-forward visual geometry foundation model. Specifically, we propose a dual-encoder architecture: a pretrained 2D visual encoder to extract semantic features, and a spatial encoder-initialized from the backbone of the visual geometry model-to extract 3D structure features. A connector then integrates both features into unified visual tokens for enhanced spatial understanding. Furthermore, we propose a space-aware frame sampling strategy at inference time, which selects the spatially informative frames of a video sequence, ensuring that even under limited token length, the model focuses on frames critical for spatial reasoning. Beyond architecture improvements, we construct the Spatial-MLLM-120k dataset and train the model on it using supervised fine-tuning and GRPO. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our spatial-MLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of visual-based spatial understanding and reasoning tasks.

| **[Visatronic: A Multimodal Decoder-Only Model for Speech Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17690v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress of foundation models and large language models (LLMs) has fueled significantly improvement in the capabilities of machine learning systems that benefit from mutlimodal input data. However, existing multimodal models are predominantly built on top of pre-trained LLMs, which can limit accurate modeling of temporal dependencies across other modalities and thus limit the model's ability to jointly process and leverage multimodal inputs. To specifically investigate the alignment of text, video, and speech modalities in LLM-style (decoder-only) models, we consider a simplified multimodal generation task, Video-Text to Speech (VTTS): speech generation conditioned on both its corresponding text and video of talking people. The ultimate goal is to generate speech that not only follows the text but also aligns temporally with the video and is consistent with the facial expressions. In this paper, we first introduce Visatronic, a unified multimodal decoder-only transformer model that adopts an LLM-style architecture to embed visual, textual, and speech inputs into a shared subspace, treating all modalities as temporally aligned token streams. Next, we carefully explore different token mixing strategies to understand the best way to propagate information from the steps where video and text conditioning is input to the steps where the audio is generated. We extensively evaluate Visatronic on the challenging VoxCeleb2 dataset and demonstrate zero-shot generalization to LRS3, where Visatronic, trained on VoxCeleb2, achieves a 4.5% WER, outperforming prior SOTA methods trained only on LRS3, which report a 21.4% WER. Additionally, we propose a new objective metric, TimeSync, specifically designed to measure phoneme-level temporal alignment between generated and reference speech, further ensuring synchronization quality.

While existing approaches typically frame this as a multi-objective optimization problem, they often overlook how humans actually make decisions. Research on bounded rationality suggests that human decision making follows satisficing strategies-optimizing primary objectives while ensuring others meet acceptable thresholds. To bridge this gap and operationalize the notion of satisficing alignment, we propose SITAlign: an inference time framework that addresses the multifaceted nature of alignment by maximizing a primary objective while satisfying threshold-based constraints on secondary criteria. We provide theoretical insights by deriving sub-optimality bounds of our satisficing based inference alignment approach. We empirically validate SITAlign's performance through extensive experimentation on multiple benchmarks. For instance, on the PKU-SafeRLHF dataset with the primary objective of maximizing helpfulness while ensuring a threshold on harmlessness, SITAlign outperforms the state-of-the-art multi objective decoding strategy by a margin of 22.3% in terms of GPT-4 win-tie rate for helpfulness reward while adhering to the threshold on harmlessness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |

However, they exhibit limited generalization to out-of-distribution scenarios without an explicit reasoning process. Although recent efforts leverage reinforcement learning through group-relative policy optimization (GRPO) to enhance reasoning ability, they often suffer from overthinking - producing uniformly verbose reasoning chains irrespective of task complexity. This results in elevated computational costs and limited control over reasoning quality. To address this problem, we propose PixelThink, a simple yet effective scheme that integrates externally estimated task difficulty and internally measured model uncertainty to regulate reasoning generation within a reinforcement learning paradigm. The model learns to compress reasoning length in accordance with scene complexity and predictive confidence. To support comprehensive evaluation, we introduce ReasonSeg-Diff, an extended benchmark with annotated reasoning references and difficulty scores, along with a suite of metrics designed to assess segmentation accuracy, reasoning quality, and efficiency jointly. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach improves both reasoning efficiency and overall segmentation performance. Our work contributes novel perspectives towards efficient and interpretable multimodal understanding. The code and model will be publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://PixelThink.github.io</p></details> |

Despite significantly reducing communication frequency, however, DiLoCo's communication steps still involve all-reducing a complete copy of the model's parameters. While existing works have explored ways to reduce communication in DiLoCo, the role of error feedback accumulators and the effect of the inner-optimizer on compressibility remain under-explored. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of standard compression methods including Top-k sparsification and quantization for reducing the communication overhead of DiLoCo when paired with two local optimizers (AdamW and Muon). Our experiments pre-training decoder-only transformer language models (LMs) reveal that leveraging Muon as the inner optimizer for DiLoCo along with an error-feedback accumulator allows to aggressively compress the communicated delta to 2-bits with next to no performance degradation. Crucially, MuLoCo (Muon inner optimizer DiLoCo) significantly outperforms DiLoCo while communicating 8X less and having identical memory complexity.</p></details> |  |

However, vanilla LoRA suffers from slow convergence speed and knowledge forgetting problems. Recent studies have leveraged the power of designed LoRA initialization, to enhance the fine-tuning efficiency, or to preserve knowledge in the pre-trained LLM. However, none of these works can address the two cases at the same time. To this end, we introduce Subspace-Constrained LoRA (SC-LoRA), a novel LoRA initialization framework engineered to navigate the trade-off between efficient fine-tuning and knowledge preservation. We achieve this by constraining the output of trainable LoRA adapters in a low-rank subspace, where the context information of fine-tuning data is most preserved while the context information of preserved knowledge is least retained, in a balanced way. Such constraint enables the trainable weights to primarily focus on the main features of fine-tuning data while avoiding damaging the preserved knowledge features. We provide theoretical analysis on our method, and conduct extensive experiments including safety preservation and world knowledge preservation, on various downstream tasks. In our experiments, SC-LoRA succeeds in delivering superior fine-tuning performance while markedly diminishing knowledge forgetting, surpassing contemporary LoRA initialization methods.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing approaches rely heavily on manual prompt engineering, failing to adapt and optimize based on diverse experimental experiences. Focusing on this, for the first time, we explore the paradigm of learning-based agentic ML, where an LLM agent learns through interactive experimentation on ML tasks using online reinforcement learning (RL). To realize this, we propose a novel agentic ML training framework with three key components: (1) exploration-enriched fine-tuning, which enables LLM agents to generate diverse actions for enhanced RL exploration; (2) step-wise RL, which enables training on a single action step, accelerating experience collection and improving training efficiency; (3) an agentic ML-specific reward module, which unifies varied ML feedback signals into consistent rewards for RL optimization. Leveraging this framework, we train ML-Agent, driven by a 7B-sized Qwen-2.5 LLM for autonomous ML. Remarkably, despite being trained on merely 9 ML tasks, our 7B-sized ML-Agent outperforms the 671B-sized DeepSeek-R1 agent. Furthermore, it achieves continuous performance improvements and demonstrates exceptional cross-task generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Label-Guided In-Context Learning for Named Entity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23722v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to perform new tasks using only a few demonstrations. In Named Entity Recognition (NER), demonstrations are typically selected based on semantic similarity to the test instance, ignoring training labels and resulting in suboptimal performance. We introduce DEER, a new method that leverages training labels through token-level statistics to improve ICL performance. DEER first enhances example selection with a label-guided, token-based retriever that prioritizes tokens most informative for entity recognition. It then prompts the LLM to revisit error-prone tokens, which are also identified using label statistics, and make targeted corrections. Evaluated on five NER datasets using four different LLMs, DEER consistently outperforms existing ICL methods and approaches the performance of supervised fine-tuning. Further analysis shows its effectiveness on both seen and unseen entities and its robustness in low-resource settings.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Length-Controlled Margin-Based Preference Optimization without Reference Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14643v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a widely adopted offline algorithm for preference-based reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), designed to improve training simplicity and stability by redefining reward functions. However, DPO is hindered by several limitations, including length bias, memory inefficiency, and probability degradation. To address these challenges, we propose Length-Controlled Margin-Based Preference Optimization (LMPO), a more efficient and robust alternative. LMPO introduces a uniform reference model as an upper bound for the DPO loss, enabling a more accurate approximation of the original optimization objective. Additionally, an average log-probability optimization strategy is employed to minimize discrepancies between training and inference phases. A key innovation of LMPO lies in its Length-Controlled Margin-Based loss function, integrated within the Bradley-Terry framework. This loss function regulates response length while simultaneously widening the margin between preferred and rejected outputs. By doing so, it mitigates probability degradation for both accepted and discarded responses, addressing a significant limitation of existing methods. We evaluate LMPO against state-of-the-art preference optimization techniques on two open-ended large language models, Mistral and LLaMA3, across six conditional benchmarks. Our experimental results demonstrate that LMPO effectively controls response length, reduces probability degradation, and outperforms existing approaches.

| **[TiRex: Zero-Shot Forecasting Across Long and Short Horizons with Enhanced In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23719v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context learning, the ability of large language models to perform tasks using only examples provided in the prompt, has recently been adapted for time series forecasting. This paradigm enables zero-shot prediction, where past values serve as context for forecasting future values, making powerful forecasting tools accessible to non-experts and increasing the performance when training data are scarce. Most existing zero-shot forecasting approaches rely on transformer architectures, which, despite their success in language, often fall short of expectations in time series forecasting, where recurrent models like LSTMs frequently have the edge. Conversely, while LSTMs are well-suited for time series modeling due to their state-tracking capabilities, they lack strong in-context learning abilities. We introduce TiRex that closes this gap by leveraging xLSTM, an enhanced LSTM with competitive in-context learning skills. Unlike transformers, state-space models, or parallelizable RNNs such as RWKV, TiRex retains state-tracking, a critical property for long-horizon forecasting. To further facilitate its state-tracking ability, we propose a training-time masking strategy called CPM. TiRex sets a new state of the art in zero-shot time series forecasting on the HuggingFace benchmarks GiftEval and Chronos-ZS, outperforming significantly larger models including TabPFN-TS (Prior Labs), Chronos Bolt (Amazon), TimesFM (Google), and Moirai (Salesforce) across both short- and long-term forecasts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Don't Take the Premise for Granted: Evaluating the Premise Critique Ability of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23715v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have witnessed rapid advancements, demonstrating remarkable capabilities. However, a notable vulnerability persists: LLMs often uncritically accept flawed or contradictory premises, leading to inefficient reasoning and unreliable outputs. This emphasizes the significance of possessing the \textbf{Premise Critique Ability} for LLMs, defined as the capacity to proactively identify and articulate errors in input premises. Most existing studies assess LLMs' reasoning ability in ideal settings, largely ignoring their vulnerabilities when faced with flawed premises. Thus, we introduce the \textbf{Premise Critique Bench (PCBench)}, designed by incorporating four error types across three difficulty levels, paired with multi-faceted evaluation metrics. We conducted systematic evaluations of 15 representative LLMs. Our findings reveal: (1) Most models rely heavily on explicit prompts to detect errors, with limited autonomous critique; (2) Premise critique ability depends on question difficulty and error type, with direct contradictions being easier to detect than complex or procedural errors; (3) Reasoning ability does not consistently correlate with the premise critique ability; (4) Flawed premises trigger overthinking in reasoning models, markedly lengthening responses due to repeated attempts at resolving conflicts. These insights underscore the urgent need to enhance LLMs' proactive evaluation of input validity, positioning premise critique as a foundational capability for developing reliable, human-centric systems.

Success in these contexts depends on a model's social reasoning ability - the capacity to interpret social contexts, infer others' mental states, and assess the truthfulness of presented information. However, there is currently no systematic evaluation framework that comprehensively assesses the social reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Existing efforts often oversimplify real-world scenarios and consist of tasks that are too basic to challenge advanced models. To address this gap, we introduce SocialMaze, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate social reasoning. SocialMaze systematically incorporates three core challenges: deep reasoning, dynamic interaction, and information uncertainty. It provides six diverse tasks across three key settings: social reasoning games, daily-life interactions, and digital community platforms. Both automated and human validation are used to ensure data quality. Our evaluation reveals several key insights: models vary substantially in their ability to handle dynamic interactions and integrate temporally evolving information; models with strong chain-of-thought reasoning perform better on tasks requiring deeper inference beyond surface-level cues; and model reasoning degrades significantly under uncertainty. Furthermore, we show that targeted fine-tuning on curated reasoning examples can greatly improve model performance in complex social scenarios.

Disentangling Abstract Formulation From Arithmetic Computation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23701v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Final-answer-based metrics are commonly used for evaluating large language models (LLMs) on math word problems, often taken as proxies for reasoning ability. However, such metrics conflate two distinct sub-skills: abstract formulation (capturing mathematical relationships using expressions) and arithmetic computation (executing the calculations). Through a disentangled evaluation on GSM8K and SVAMP, we find that the final-answer accuracy of Llama-3 and Qwen2.5 (1B-32B) without CoT is overwhelmingly bottlenecked by the arithmetic computation step and not by the abstract formulation step. Contrary to the common belief, we show that CoT primarily aids in computation, with limited impact on abstract formulation. Mechanistically, we show that these two skills are composed conjunctively even in a single forward pass without any reasoning steps via an abstract-then-compute mechanism: models first capture problem abstractions, then handle computation. Causal patching confirms these abstractions are present, transferable, composable, and precede computation. These behavioural and mechanistic findings highlight the need for disentangled evaluation to accurately assess LLM reasoning and to guide future improvements.</p></details> |  |

However, the irreversible nature of CoT leads to error accumulation, making it challenging to correct mistakes in multi-hop reasoning. This paper introduces ReAgent: a Reversible multi-Agent collaborative framework augmented with explicit backtracking mechanisms, enabling reversible multi-hop reasoning. By incorporating text-based retrieval, information aggregation and validation, our system can detect and correct errors mid-reasoning, leading to more robust and interpretable QA outcomes. The framework and experiments serve as a foundation for future work on error-tolerant QA systems. Empirical evaluations across three benchmarks indicate ReAgent's efficacy, yielding average about 6\% improvements against baseline models.</p></details> | 25pages, 3 figures |

While large language models (LMs) demonstrate strong general reasoning abilities, they continue to struggle with accurate numerical or symbolic reasoning over tabular data, especially in complex scenarios. Spreadsheet formulas provide a powerful and expressive medium for representing executable symbolic operations, encoding rich reasoning patterns that remain largely underutilized. In this paper, we propose Formula Tuning (Fortune), a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that trains LMs to generate executable spreadsheet formulas for question answering over general tabular data. Formula Tuning reduces the reliance on supervised formula annotations by using binary answer correctness as a reward signal, guiding the model to learn formula derivation through reasoning. We provide a theoretical analysis of its advantages and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on seven table reasoning benchmarks. Formula Tuning substantially enhances LM performance, particularly on multi-step numerical and symbolic reasoning tasks, enabling a 7B model to outperform O1 on table understanding. This highlights the potential of formula-driven RL to advance symbolic table reasoning in LMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[LoLA: Low-Rank Linear Attention With Sparse Caching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23666v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based large language models suffer from quadratic complexity at inference on long sequences. Linear attention methods are efficient alternatives, however, they fail to provide an accurate approximation of softmax attention. By additionally incorporating sliding window attention into each linear attention head, this gap can be closed for short context-length tasks. Unfortunately, these approaches cannot recall important information from long contexts due to "memory collisions". In this paper , we propose LoLA: Low-rank Linear Attention with sparse caching. LoLA separately stores additional key-value pairs that would otherwise interfere with past associative memories. Moreover, LoLA further closes the gap between linear attention models and transformers by distributing past key-value pairs into three forms of memory: (i) recent pairs in a local sliding window; (ii) difficult-to-memorize pairs in a sparse, global cache; and (iii) generic pairs in the recurrent hidden state of linear attention. As an inference-only strategy, LoLA enables pass-key retrieval on up to 8K context lengths on needle-in-a-haystack tasks from RULER. It boosts the accuracy of the base subquadratic model from 0.6% to 97.4% at 4K context lengths, with a 4.6x smaller cache than that of Llama-3.1 8B. LoLA demonstrates strong performance on zero-shot commonsense reasoning tasks among 1B and 8B parameter subquadratic models. Finally, LoLA is an extremely lightweight approach: Nearly all of our results can be reproduced on a single consumer GPU.</p></details> |  |

The over 5K questions in our collection span a variety of scientific topics and include factual, application, and reasoning-based questions. We use our parallel dataset to test a number of Large Language Models (LLMs) and find a significant performance difference between the models in English and Dzongkha. We also look at different prompting strategies and discover that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting works well for reasoning questions but less well for factual ones. We also find that adding English translations enhances the precision of Dzongkha question responses. Our results point to exciting avenues for further study to improve LLM performance in Dzongkha and, more generally, in low-resource languages.

To fill this gap, we introduce ToolHaystack, a benchmark for testing the tool use capabilities in long-term interactions. Each test instance in ToolHaystack includes multiple tasks execution contexts and realistic noise within a continuous conversation, enabling assessment of how well models maintain context and handle various disruptions. By applying this benchmark to 14 state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that while current models perform well in standard multi-turn settings, they often significantly struggle in ToolHaystack, highlighting critical gaps in their long-term robustness not revealed by previous tool benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code and data are available at https://github.com/bwookwak/ToolHaystack</p></details> |

Inspired by prevailing practices in unified model learning, we adopt an efficient training strategy that minimizes the training complexity and overhead by bridging the off-the-shelf multimodal large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models through a set of learnable queries and a light-weight transformer-based connector. With a minimalist choice of architecture, we demonstrate that OpenUni can: 1) generate high-quality and instruction-aligned images, and 2) achieve exceptional performance on standard benchmarks such as GenEval, DPG- Bench, and WISE, with only 1.1B and 3.1B activated parameters. To support open research and community advancement, we release all model weights, training code, and our curated training datasets (including 23M image-text pairs) at https://github.com/wusize/OpenUni.</p></details> |  |
| **[D-AR: Diffusion via Autoregressive Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23660v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents Diffusion via Autoregressive models (D-AR), a new paradigm recasting the image diffusion process as a vanilla autoregressive procedure in the standard next-token-prediction fashion. We start by designing the tokenizer that converts images into sequences of discrete tokens, where tokens in different positions can be decoded into different diffusion denoising steps in the pixel space. Thanks to the diffusion properties, these tokens naturally follow a coarse-to-fine order, which directly lends itself to autoregressive modeling. Therefore, we apply standard next-token prediction on these tokens, without modifying any underlying designs (either causal masks or training/inference strategies), and such sequential autoregressive token generation directly mirrors the diffusion procedure in image space. That is, once the autoregressive model generates an increment of tokens, we can directly decode these tokens into the corresponding diffusion denoising step in the streaming manner. Our pipeline naturally reveals several intriguing properties, for example, it supports consistent previews when generating only a subset of tokens and enables zero-shot layout-controlled synthesis. On the standard ImageNet benchmark, our method achieves 2.09 FID using a 775M Llama backbone with 256 discrete tokens. We hope our work can inspire future research on unified autoregressive architectures of visual synthesis, especially with large language models. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/showlab/D-AR</p></details> | Technical report |

These methods typically operate at the token level, leveraging internal representations to suppress superficial patterns. Nevertheless, LLMs remain prone to hallucinations, especially over longer contexts. In this paper, we propose Active Layer-Contrastive Decoding (ActLCD), a novel decoding strategy that actively decides when to apply contrasting layers during generation. By casting decoding as a sequential decision-making problem, ActLCD employs a reinforcement learning policy guided by a reward-aware classifier to optimize factuality beyond the token level. Our experiments demonstrate that ActLCD surpasses state-of-the-art methods across five benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations in diverse generation scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we focus on a specific form of structure: argument roles, which are crucial for summarizing documents in high-stakes domains such as law. We investigate whether instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) adequately preserve this information. To this end, we introduce Argument Representation Coverage (ARC), a framework for measuring how well LLM-generated summaries capture salient arguments. Using ARC, we analyze summaries produced by three open-weight LLMs in two domains where argument roles are central: long legal opinions and scientific articles. Our results show that while LLMs cover salient argument roles to some extent, critical information is often omitted in generated summaries, particularly when arguments are sparsely distributed throughout the input. Further, we use ARC to uncover behavioral patterns -- specifically, how the positional bias of LLM context windows and role-specific preferences impact the coverage of key arguments in generated summaries, emphasizing the need for more argument-aware summarization strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[How does Transformer Learn Implicit Reasoning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23653v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) can perform multi-hop reasoning implicitly -- producing correct answers without explicitly verbalizing intermediate steps -- but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this paper, we study how such implicit reasoning emerges by training transformers from scratch in a controlled symbolic environment. Our analysis reveals a three-stage developmental trajectory: early memorization, followed by in-distribution generalization, and eventually cross-distribution generalization. We find that training with atomic triples is not necessary but accelerates learning, and that second-hop generalization relies on query-level exposure to specific compositional structures. To interpret these behaviors, we introduce two diagnostic tools: cross-query semantic patching, which identifies semantically reusable intermediate representations, and a cosine-based representational lens, which reveals that successful reasoning correlates with the cosine-base clustering in hidden space. This clustering phenomenon in turn provides a coherent explanation for the behavioral dynamics observed across training, linking representational structure to reasoning capability. These findings provide new insights into the interpretability of implicit multi-hop reasoning in LLMs, helping to clarify how complex reasoning processes unfold internally and offering pathways to enhance the transparency of such models.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces the Generative Agents for Multi-Agent Autoformalization (GAMA) framework, which automates the formalization of interaction scenarios in simulations using agents augmented with large language models (LLMs). To demonstrate the application of GAMA, we use natural language descriptions of game-theoretic scenarios representing social interactions, and we autoformalize them into executable logic programs defining game rules, with syntactic correctness enforced through a solver-based validation. To ensure runtime validity, an iterative, tournament-based procedure tests the generated rules and strategies, followed by exact semantic validation when ground truth outcomes are available. In experiments with 110 natural language descriptions across five 2x2 simultaneous-move games, GAMA achieves 100% syntactic and 76.5% semantic correctness with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and 99.82% syntactic and 77% semantic correctness with GPT-4o. The framework also shows high semantic accuracy in autoformalizing agents' strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code: https://github.com/dicelab-rhul/GAMA</p></details> |

With large language models (LLMs) crossing critical reliability thresholds for a growing slate of capabilities, there is an increasing effort to decompose systems into sets of LLM-based agents, each of whom can be delegated sub-tasks. However, this decomposition (even when automated) is often intuitive, e.g., based on how a human might assign roles to members of a human team. How close are these role decompositions to optimal? This position paper argues that asymptotic analysis with LLM primitives is needed to reason about the efficiency of such decomposed systems, and that insights from such analysis will unlock opportunities for scaling them. By treating the LLM forward pass as the atomic unit of computational cost, one can separate out the (often opaque) inner workings of a particular LLM from the inherent efficiency of how a set of LLMs are orchestrated to solve hard problems. In other words, if we want to scale the deployment of LLMs to the limit, instead of anthropomorphizing LLMs, asymptotic analysis with LLM primitives should be used to reason about and develop more powerful decompositions of large problems into LLM agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 42nd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2025); 13 pages including references</p></details> |

However, recent work has shown the MCP is susceptible to retrieval-based "falsely benign" attacks (FBAs), allowing malicious system access and credential theft, but requiring that users download compromised files directly to their systems. Herein, we show that the threat model of MCP-based attacks is significantly broader than previously thought, i.e., attackers need only post malicious content online to deceive MCP agents into carrying out their attacks on unsuspecting victims' systems. To improve alignment guardrails against such attacks, we introduce a new MCP dataset of FBAs and (truly) benign samples to explore the effectiveness of direct preference optimization (DPO) for the refusal training of large language models (LLMs). While DPO improves model guardrails against such attacks, we show that the efficacy of refusal learning varies drastically depending on the model's original post-training alignment scheme--e.g., GRPO-based LLMs learn to refuse extremely poorly. Thus, to further improve FBA refusals, we introduce Retrieval Augmented Generation for Preference alignment (RAG-Pref), a novel preference alignment strategy based on RAG. We show that RAG-Pref significantly improves the ability of LLMs to refuse FBAs, particularly when combined with DPO alignment, thus drastically improving guardrails against MCP-based attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 19 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

For those purposes, NVIDIA's recent Blackwell architecture facilitates very low-precision operations using FP4 variants. Yet, current algorithms for training LLMs in FP4 precision face significant accuracy degradation and often rely on mixed-precision fallbacks. In this paper, we investigate hardware-supported FP4 training and introduce a new approach for accurate, end-to-end FP4 training with all the major computations (i.e., linear layers) in low precision. Through extensive evaluations on Llama-type models, we reveal a new low-precision scaling law that quantifies performance trade-offs across bit-widths and training setups. Guided by this investigation, we design an "optimal" technique in terms of accuracy-vs-computation, called Quartet. We implement Quartet using optimized CUDA kernels tailored for Blackwell, demonstrating that fully FP4-based training is a competitive alternative to FP16 half-precision and to FP8 training. Our code is available at https://github.com/IST-DASLab/Quartet.</p></details> |  |
| **[RULEBREAKERS: Challenging LLMs at the Crossroads between Formal Logic and Human-like Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16502v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Formal logic enables computers to reason in natural language by representing sentences in symbolic forms and applying rules to derive conclusions. However, in what our study characterizes as "rulebreaker" scenarios, this method can lead to conclusions that are typically not inferred or accepted by humans given their common sense and factual knowledge. Inspired by works in cognitive science, we create RULEBREAKERS, the first dataset for rigorously evaluating the ability of large language models (LLMs) to recognize and respond to rulebreakers (versus non-rulebreakers) in a human-like manner. Evaluating seven LLMs, we find that most models, including GPT-4o, achieve mediocre accuracy on RULEBREAKERS and exhibit some tendency to over-rigidly apply logical rules unlike what is expected from typical human reasoners. Further analysis suggests that this apparent failure is potentially associated with the models' poor utilization of their world knowledge and their attention distribution patterns. Whilst revealing a limitation of current LLMs, our study also provides a timely counterbalance to a growing body of recent works that propose methods relying on formal logic to improve LLMs' general reasoning capabilities, highlighting their risk of further increasing divergence between LLMs and human-like reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Current large language model (LLM)-based agents, however, remain stateless and unable to accumulate or transfer knowledge over time. Existing benchmarks treat agents as static systems and fail to evaluate lifelong learning capabilities. We present LifelongAgentBench, the first unified benchmark designed to systematically assess the lifelong learning ability of LLM agents. It provides skill-grounded, interdependent tasks across three interactive environments, Database, Operating System, and Knowledge Graph, with automatic label verification, reproducibility, and modular extensibility. Extensive experiments reveal that conventional experience replay has limited effectiveness for LLM agents due to irrelevant information and context length constraints. We further introduce a group self-consistency mechanism that significantly improves lifelong learning performance. We hope LifelongAgentBench will advance the development of adaptive, memory-capable LLM agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comprehensive Evaluation of Multi-Modal Large Language Models for Endoscopy Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23601v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Endoscopic procedures are essential for diagnosing and treating internal diseases, and multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied to assist in endoscopy analysis. However, current benchmarks are limited, as they typically cover specific endoscopic scenarios and a small set of clinical tasks, failing to capture the real-world diversity of endoscopic scenarios and the full range of skills needed in clinical workflows. To address these issues, we introduce EndoBench, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to assess MLLMs across the full spectrum of endoscopic practice with multi-dimensional capacities. EndoBench encompasses 4 distinct endoscopic scenarios, 12 specialized clinical tasks with 12 secondary subtasks, and 5 levels of visual prompting granularities, resulting in 6,832 rigorously validated VQA pairs from 21 diverse datasets. Our multi-dimensional evaluation framework mirrors the clinical workflow--spanning anatomical recognition, lesion analysis, spatial localization, and surgical operations--to holistically gauge the perceptual and diagnostic abilities of MLLMs in realistic scenarios. We benchmark 23 state-of-the-art models, including general-purpose, medical-specialized, and proprietary MLLMs, and establish human clinician performance as a reference standard. Our extensive experiments reveal: (1) proprietary MLLMs outperform open-source and medical-specialized models overall, but still trail human experts; (2) medical-domain supervised fine-tuning substantially boosts task-specific accuracy; and (3) model performance remains sensitive to prompt format and clinical task complexity. EndoBench establishes a new standard for evaluating and advancing MLLMs in endoscopy, highlighting both progress and persistent gaps between current models and expert clinical reasoning. We publicly release our benchmark and code.</p></details> | 36 pages, 18 figures |

Existing work primarily focuses on behavior cloning from expert demonstrations or preference learning through exploratory trajectory sampling. However, these methods often struggle to address long-horizon tasks, where suboptimal actions accumulate step by step, causing agents to deviate from correct task trajectories. To address this, we highlight the importance of timely calibration and the need to automatically construct calibration trajectories for training agents. We propose Step-Level Trajectory Calibration (STeCa), a novel framework for LLM agent learning. Specifically, STeCa identifies suboptimal actions through a step-level reward comparison during exploration. It constructs calibrated trajectories using LLM-driven reflection, enabling agents to learn from improved decision-making processes. We finally leverage these calibrated trajectories with successful trajectories for reinforced training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STeCa significantly outperforms existing methods. Further analysis highlights that timely calibration enables agents to complete tasks with greater robustness.

Focusing on competitive programming and benchmark tasks (LeetCode and MATH), we compare performance across multiple models and obfuscation methods, such as noise and redaction. We demonstrate that all evaluated LLMs can solve tasks obfuscated to a level where the text would be unintelligible to human readers, and does not contain key pieces of instruction or context. We introduce the concept of eager pattern matching to describe this behaviour, which is not observed in tasks published after the models' knowledge cutoff date, indicating strong memorisation or overfitting to training data, rather than legitimate reasoning about the presented problem. We report empirical evidence of distinct performance decay patterns between contaminated and unseen datasets. We discuss the implications for benchmarking and evaluations of model behaviour, arguing for caution when designing experiments using standard datasets. We also propose measuring the decay of performance under obfuscation as a possible strategy for detecting dataset contamination and highlighting potential safety risks and interpretability issues for automated software systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAPLE: A Mobile Assistant with Persistent Finite State Machines for Recovery Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23596v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile GUI agents aim to autonomously complete user-instructed tasks across mobile apps. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) enable these agents to interpret UI screens, identify actionable elements, and perform interactions such as tapping or typing. However, existing agents remain reactive: they reason only over the current screen and lack a structured model of app navigation flow, limiting their ability to understand context, detect unexpected outcomes, and recover from errors. We present MAPLE, a state-aware multi-agent framework that abstracts app interactions as a Finite State Machine (FSM). We computationally model each UI screen as a discrete state and user actions as transitions, allowing the FSM to provide a structured representation of the app execution. MAPLE consists of specialized agents responsible for four phases of task execution: planning, execution, verification, error recovery, and knowledge retention. These agents collaborate to dynamically construct FSMs in real time based on perception data extracted from the UI screen, allowing the GUI agents to track navigation progress and flow, validate action outcomes through pre- and post-conditions of the states, and recover from errors by rolling back to previously stable states. Our evaluation results on two challenging cross-app benchmarks, Mobile-Eval-E and SPA-Bench, show that MAPLE outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline, improving task success rate by up to 12%, recovery success by 13.8%, and action accuracy by 6.5%. Our results highlight the importance of structured state modeling in guiding mobile GUI agents during task execution. Moreover, our FSM representation can be integrated into future GUI agent architectures as a lightweight, model-agnostic memory layer to support structured planning, execution verification, and error recovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[X-TURING: Towards an Enhanced and Efficient Turing Test for Long-Term Dialogue Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09853v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Turing test examines whether AIs exhibit human-like behaviour in natural language conversations. The traditional setting limits each participant to one message at a time and requires constant human participation. This fails to reflect a natural conversational style and hinders the evaluation of dialogue agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex and prolonged interactions. This paper proposes \textbf{\textsc{X-Turing}}, which enhances the original test with a \textit{burst dialogue} pattern, allowing more dynamic exchanges using consecutive messages. It further reduces human workload by iteratively generating dialogues that simulate the long-term interaction between the agent and a human to compose the majority of the test process. With the \textit{pseudo-dialogue} history, the agent then engages in a shorter dialogue with a real human, which is paired with a human-human conversation on the same topic to be judged using questionnaires. We introduce the \textit{X-Turn Pass-Rate} metric to assess the human likeness of LLMs across varying durations. While LLMs like GPT-4 initially perform well, achieving pass rates of 51.9\% and 38.9\% during 3 turns and 10 turns of dialogues respectively, their performance drops as the dialogue progresses, which underscores the difficulty in maintaining consistency in the long term.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

This paper provides a comprehensive study of rule-based visual RL using jigsaw puzzles as a structured experimental framework, revealing several key findings. \textit{Firstly,} we find that MLLMs, initially performing near to random guessing on simple puzzles, achieve near-perfect accuracy and generalize to complex, unseen configurations through fine-tuning. \textit{Secondly,} training on jigsaw puzzles can induce generalization to other visual tasks, with effectiveness tied to specific task configurations. \textit{Thirdly,} MLLMs can learn and generalize with or without explicit reasoning, though open-source models often favor direct answering. Consequently, even when trained for step-by-step reasoning, they can ignore the thinking process in deriving the final answer. \textit{Fourthly,} we observe that complex reasoning patterns appear to be pre-existing rather than emergent, with their frequency increasing alongside training and task difficulty. \textit{Finally,} our results demonstrate that RL exhibits more effective generalization than Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and an initial SFT cold start phase can hinder subsequent RL optimization. Although these observations are based on jigsaw puzzles and may vary across other visual tasks, this research contributes a valuable piece of jigsaw to the larger puzzle of collective understanding rule-based visual RL and its potential in multimodal learning.

| **[On-Policy RL with Optimal Reward Baseline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23585v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning algorithms are fundamental to align large language models with human preferences and to enhance their reasoning capabilities. However, current reinforcement learning algorithms often suffer from training instability due to loose on-policy constraints and computational inefficiency due to auxiliary models. In this work, we propose On-Policy RL with Optimal reward baseline (OPO), a novel and simplified reinforcement learning algorithm designed to address these challenges. OPO emphasizes the importance of exact on-policy training, which empirically stabilizes the training process and enhances exploration. Moreover, OPO introduces the optimal reward baseline that theoretically minimizes gradient variance. We evaluate OPO on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. The results demonstrate its superior performance and training stability without additional models or regularization terms. Furthermore, OPO achieves lower policy shifts and higher output entropy, encouraging more diverse and less repetitive responses. These results highlight OPO as a promising direction for stable and effective reinforcement learning in large language model alignment and reasoning tasks. The implementation is provided at https://github.com/microsoft/LMOps/tree/main/opo.</p></details> |  |

Current DNA foundation models, despite strong sequence representation, struggle with multi-step reasoning and lack inherent transparent, biologically intuitive explanations. We introduce BioReason, a pioneering architecture that, for the first time, deeply integrates a DNA foundation model with a Large Language Model (LLM). This novel connection enables the LLM to directly process and reason with genomic information as a fundamental input, fostering a new form of multimodal biological understanding. BioReason's sophisticated multi-step reasoning is developed through supervised fine-tuning and targeted reinforcement learning, guiding the system to generate logical, biologically coherent deductions. On biological reasoning benchmarks including KEGG-based disease pathway prediction - where accuracy improves from 88% to 97% - and variant effect prediction, BioReason demonstrates an average 15% performance gain over strong single-modality baselines. BioReason reasons over unseen biological entities and articulates decision-making through interpretable, step-by-step biological traces, offering a transformative approach for AI in biology that enables deeper mechanistic insights and accelerates testable hypothesis generation from genomic data.

Yet, the underlying concepts that drive these preferences remain poorly understood. In this work, we propose a fully automated method for generating local and global concept-based explanations of preferences across multiple domains. Our method utilizes an LLM to identify concepts that distinguish between chosen and rejected responses, and to represent them with concept-based vectors. To model the relationships between concepts and preferences, we propose a white-box Hierarchical Multi-Domain Regression model that captures both domain-general and domain-specific effects. To evaluate our method, we curate a dataset spanning eight challenging and diverse domains and explain twelve mechanisms. Our method achieves strong preference prediction performance, outperforming baselines while also being explainable. Additionally, we assess explanations in two application-driven settings. First, guiding LLM outputs with concepts from LaaJ explanations yields responses that those judges consistently prefer. Second, prompting LaaJs with concepts explaining humans improves their preference predictions. Together, our work establishes a new paradigm for explainability in the era of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

In these settings, they use computer vision (CV) to detect objects of interest and autonomously adapt their missions. However, traditional CV systems often struggle to recognize unfamiliar objects in open-world environments or to infer their relevance for mission planning. To address this, we incorporate large language models (LLMs) to reason about detected objects and their implications. While LLMs can offer valuable insights, they are also prone to hallucinations and may produce incorrect, misleading, or unsafe recommendations. To ensure safe and sensible decision-making under uncertainty, high-level decisions must be governed by cognitive guardrails. This article presents the design, simulation, and real-world integration of these guardrails for sUAS swarms in search-and-rescue missions.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |

This study explores the use of open-weight Large Language Models (LLMs), both text-only and multimodal, for identifying conspiracy theory videos shared on YouTube. Leveraging a labeled dataset of thousands of videos, we evaluate a variety of LLMs in a zero-shot setting and compare their performance to a fine-tuned RoBERTa baseline. Results show that text-based LLMs achieve high recall but lower precision, leading to increased false positives. Multimodal models lag behind their text-only counterparts, indicating limited benefits from visual data integration. To assess real-world applicability, we evaluate the most accurate models on an unlabeled dataset, finding that RoBERTa achieves performance close to LLMs with a larger number of parameters. Our work highlights the strengths and limitations of current LLM-based approaches for online harmful content detection, emphasizing the need for more precise and robust systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for review to OSNEM Special Issue of April 2025</p></details> |

Existing approaches primarily adopt two contrasting advantage estimation granularities: Token-level methods (e.g., PPO) aim to provide the fine-grained advantage signals but suffer from inaccurate estimation due to difficulties in training an accurate critic model. On the other extreme, trajectory-level methods (e.g., GRPO) solely rely on a coarse-grained advantage signal from the final reward, leading to imprecise credit assignment. To address these limitations, we propose Segment Policy Optimization (SPO), a novel RL framework that leverages segment-level advantage estimation at an intermediate granularity, achieving a better balance by offering more precise credit assignment than trajectory-level methods and requiring fewer estimation points than token-level methods, enabling accurate advantage estimation based on Monte Carlo (MC) without a critic model. SPO features three components with novel strategies: (1) flexible segment partition; (2) accurate segment advantage estimation; and (3) policy optimization using segment advantages, including a novel probability-mask strategy. We further instantiate SPO for two specific scenarios: (1) SPO-chain for short chain-of-thought (CoT), featuring novel cutpoint-based partition and chain-based advantage estimation, achieving $6$-$12$ percentage point improvements in accuracy over PPO and GRPO on GSM8K. (2) SPO-tree for long CoT, featuring novel tree-based advantage estimation, which significantly reduces the cost of MC estimation, achieving $7$-$11$ percentage point improvements over GRPO on MATH500 under 2K and 4K context evaluation. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/AIFrameResearch/SPO.</p></details> |  |

We introduce LEXam, a novel benchmark derived from 340 law exams spanning 116 law school courses across a range of subjects and degree levels. The dataset comprises 4,886 law exam questions in English and German, including 2,841 long-form, open-ended questions and 2,045 multiple-choice questions. Besides reference answers, the open questions are also accompanied by explicit guidance outlining the expected legal reasoning approach such as issue spotting, rule recall, or rule application. Our evaluation on both open-ended and multiple-choice questions present significant challenges for current LLMs; in particular, they notably struggle with open questions that require structured, multi-step legal reasoning. Moreover, our results underscore the effectiveness of the dataset in differentiating between models with varying capabilities. Adopting an LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm with rigorous human expert validation, we demonstrate how model-generated reasoning steps can be evaluated consistently and accurately. Our evaluation setup provides a scalable method to assess legal reasoning quality beyond simple accuracy metrics. Project page: https://lexam-benchmark.github.io/</p></details> |  |

However, due to potential vulnerabilities in models available on open-source platforms, model merging is susceptible to backdoor attacks. In this paper, we propose Merge Hijacking, the first backdoor attack targeting model merging in LLMs. The attacker constructs a malicious upload model and releases it. Once a victim user merges it with any other models, the resulting merged model inherits the backdoor while maintaining utility across tasks. Merge Hijacking defines two main objectives-effectiveness and utility-and achieves them through four steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack across different models, merging algorithms, and tasks. Additionally, we show that the attack remains effective even when merging real-world models. Moreover, our attack demonstrates robustness against two inference-time defenses (Paraphrasing and CLEANGEN) and one training-time defense (Fine-pruning).</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ACL 2025 main conference</p></details> |

To systematically address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{SafeScientist}, an innovative AI scientist framework explicitly designed to enhance safety and ethical responsibility in AI-driven scientific exploration. SafeScientist proactively refuses ethically inappropriate or high-risk tasks and rigorously emphasizes safety throughout the research process. To achieve comprehensive safety oversight, we integrate multiple defensive mechanisms, including prompt monitoring, agent-collaboration monitoring, tool-use monitoring, and an ethical reviewer component. Complementing SafeScientist, we propose \textbf{SciSafetyBench}, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate AI safety in scientific contexts, comprising 240 high-risk scientific tasks across 6 domains, alongside 30 specially designed scientific tools and 120 tool-related risk tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SafeScientist significantly improves safety performance by 35\% compared to traditional AI scientist frameworks, without compromising scientific output quality. Additionally, we rigorously validate the robustness of our safety pipeline against diverse adversarial attack methods, further confirming the effectiveness of our integrated approach.

In this work, we present a system that generates LLM personas to debate a topic of interest from different perspectives. How might information seekers use and benefit from such a system? Can centering information access around diverse viewpoints help to mitigate thorny challenges like confirmation bias in which information seekers over-trust search results matching existing beliefs? How do potential biases and hallucinations in LLMs play out alongside human users who are also fallible and possibly biased? Our study exposes participants to multiple viewpoints on controversial issues via a mixed-methods, within-subjects study. We use eye-tracking metrics to quantitatively assess cognitive engagement alongside qualitative feedback. Compared to a baseline search system, we see more creative interactions and diverse information-seeking with our multi-persona debate system, which more effectively reduces user confirmation bias and conviction toward their initial beliefs. Overall, our study contributes to the emerging design space of LLM-based information access systems, specifically investigating the potential of simulated personas to promote greater exposure to information diversity, emulate collective intelligence, and mitigate bias in information seeking.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches often inadequately overlook the theoretical and practical implications of system and data heterogeneity, thereby failing to optimize the overall training efficiency, particularly in terms of wall-clock time. In this paper, we propose an adaptive federated LoRA strategy with independent client sampling to minimize the convergence wall-clock time of federated fine-tuning under both computation and communication heterogeneity. We first derive a new convergence bound for federated LoRA with arbitrary and independent client sampling, notably without requiring the stringent bounded gradient assumption. Then, we introduce an adaptive bandwidth allocation scheme that accounts for heterogeneous client resources and system bandwidth constraints. Based on the derived theory, we formulate and solve a non-convex optimization problem to jointly determine the LoRA sketching ratios and sampling probabilities, aiming to minimize wall-clock convergence time. An efficient and low-complexity algorithm is developed to approximate the solution. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces wall-clock training time compared to state-of-the-art methods across various models and datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, Submitted to IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications (JSAC)</p></details> |

As the use of LLMs continues to grow, many efforts have focused on reducing the massive training overheads of these models. But it is the environmental impact of handling user requests to LLMs that is increasingly becoming a concern. Recent studies estimate that the costs of operating LLMs in their inference phase can exceed training costs by 25x per year. As LLMs are queried incessantly, the cumulative carbon footprint for the operational phase has been shown to far exceed the footprint during the training phase. Further, estimates indicate that 500 ml of fresh water is expended for every 20-50 requests to LLMs during inference. To address these important sustainability issues with LLMs, we propose a novel framework called SLIT to co-optimize LLM quality of service (time-to-first token), carbon emissions, water usage, and energy costs. The framework utilizes a machine learning (ML) based metaheuristic to enhance the sustainability of LLM hosting across geo-distributed cloud datacenters. Such a framework will become increasingly vital as LLMs proliferate.</p></details> |  |

The heterogeneous nature of these systems makes their safety assurance challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel automated approach for guardrailing cyber-physical systems using property-based tests (PBTs) generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach employs an LLM to extract properties from the code and documentation of CPSs. Next, we use the LLM to generate PBTs that verify the extracted properties on the CPS. The generated PBTs have two uses. First, they are used to test the CPS before it is deployed, i.e., at design time. Secondly, these PBTs can be used after deployment, i.e., at run time, to monitor the behavior of the system and guardrail it against unsafe states. We implement our approach in ChekProp and conduct preliminary experiments to evaluate the generated PBTs in terms of their relevance (how well they match manually crafted properties), executability (how many run with minimal manual modification), and effectiveness (coverage of the input space partitions). The results of our experiments and evaluation demonstrate a promising path forward for creating guardrails for CPSs using LLM-generated property-based tests.</p></details> |  |

These descriptions are derived using inputs that activate the feature, which may be a dimension or a direction in the model's representation space. However, identifying activating inputs is costly, and the mechanistic role of a feature in model behavior is determined both by how inputs cause a feature to activate and by how feature activation affects outputs. Using steering evaluations, we reveal that current pipelines provide descriptions that fail to capture the causal effect of the feature on outputs. To fix this, we propose efficient, output-centric methods for automatically generating feature descriptions. These methods use the tokens weighted higher after feature stimulation or the highest weight tokens after applying the vocabulary "unembedding" head directly to the feature. Our output-centric descriptions better capture the causal effect of a feature on model outputs than input-centric descriptions, but combining the two leads to the best performance on both input and output evaluations.

But unlike dedicated neural machine translation models, LLMs are not trained on any translation-related objective. What explains their remarkable translation abilities? Are these abilities grounded in "incidental bilingualism" (Briakou et al. 2023) in training data? Does instruction tuning contribute to it? Are LLMs capable of aligning and leveraging semantically identical or similar monolingual contents from different corners of the internet that are unlikely to fit in a single context window? I offer some reflections on this topic, informed by recent studies and growing user experience. My working hypothesis is that LLMs' translation abilities originate in two different types of pre-training data that may be internalized by the models in different ways. I discuss the prospects for testing the "duality" hypothesis empirically and its implications for reconceptualizing translation, human and machine, in the age of deep learning.</p></details> | 4 figures |

In several past years neural networks models such as YOLOv11 and Detectron2 have revolutionized visual data analysis, but their application to domain-specific cultural artifacts - such as manuscripts and incunabula - remains limited by the absence of methodologies that address structural feature extraction and semantic interoperability. In this position paper, we argue, that the integration of neural networks with semantic technologies represents a paradigm shift in cultural heritage digitization processes. We present the Metadata Enrichment Model (MEM), a conceptual framework designed to enrich metadata for digitized collections by combining fine-tuned computer vision models, large language models (LLMs) and structured knowledge graphs. The Multilayer Vision Mechanism (MVM) appears as the key innovation of MEM. This iterative process improves visual analysis by dynamically detecting nested features, such as text within seals or images within stamps. To expose MEM's potential, we apply it to a dataset of digitized incunabula from the Jagiellonian Digital Library and release a manually annotated dataset of 105 manuscript pages. We examine the practical challenges of MEM's usage in real-world GLAM institutions, including the need for domain-specific fine-tuning, the adjustment of enriched metadata with Linked Data standards and computational costs. We present MEM as a flexible and extensible methodology. This paper contributes to the discussion on how artificial intelligence and semantic web technologies can advance cultural heritage research, and also use these technologies in practice.</p></details> |  |

A Code Agent interprets an NL description of the control problem and translates it into a formal language interpretable by state-of-the-art symbolic control software, while a Checker Agent verifies the correctness of the generated code and enhances safety by identifying specification mismatches. Evaluations show that the system handles linguistic variability and improves robustness over direct planning with LLMs. The proposed approach lowers the barrier to formal control synthesis by enabling intuitive, NL-based task definition while maintaining safety guarantees through automated validation.</p></details> |  |

While current approaches leverage high-quality pairwise preference data through outcome-based criteria like answer correctness or consistency, they fundamentally neglect the internal logical coherence of responses. To overcome this, we propose Probability-Consistent Preference Optimization (PCPO), a novel framework that establishes dual quantitative metrics for preference selection: (1) surface-level answer correctness and (2) intrinsic token-level probability consistency across responses. Extensive experiments show that our PCPO consistently outperforms existing outcome-only criterion approaches across a diverse range of LLMs and benchmarks.

In this paper, we introduce Collaborative decoding via Speculation (CoS), a novel framework that accelerates collaborative decoding without compromising performance. Inspired by Speculative Decoding--where a small proposal model generates tokens sequentially, and a larger target model verifies them in parallel, our approach builds on two key insights: (1) the verification distribution can be the combined distribution of both the proposal and target models, and (2) alternating each model as the proposer and verifier can further enhance efficiency. We generalize this method to collaboration among n models and theoretically prove that CoS is never slower than standard collaborative decoding, typically achieving faster speed. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoS is 1.11x-2.23x faster than standard collaborative decoding without compromising generation quality. Our code is available at https://github.com/Kamichanw/CoS/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Domain-Aware Tensor Network Structure Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23537v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensor networks (TNs) provide efficient representations of high-dimensional data, yet identification of the optimal TN structures, the so called tensor network structure search (TN-SS) problem, remains a challenge. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms are computationally expensive as they require extensive function evaluations, which is prohibitive for real-world applications. In addition, existing methods ignore valuable domain information inherent in real-world tensor data and lack transparency in their identified TN structures. To this end, we propose a novel TN-SS framework, termed the tnLLM, which incorporates domain information about the data and harnesses the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to directly predict suitable TN structures. The proposed framework involves a domain-aware prompting pipeline which instructs the LLM to infer suitable TN structures based on the real-world relationships between tensor modes. In this way, our approach is capable of not only iteratively optimizing the objective function, but also generating domain-aware explanations for the identified structures. Experimental results demonstrate that tnLLM achieves comparable TN-SS objective function values with much fewer function evaluations compared to SOTA algorithms. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LLM-enabled domain information can be used to find good initializations in the search space for sampling-based SOTA methods to accelerate their convergence while preserving theoretical performance guarantees.</p></details> |  |

This thinking paradigm, recently, has achieved remarkable advancement in boosting Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks in digital domains. However, the potential of slow thinking remains largely unexplored for robotic foundation models interacting with the physical world. In this work, we propose Hume: a dual-system Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with value-guided System-2 thinking and cascaded action denoising, exploring human-like thinking capabilities of Vision-Language-Action models for dexterous robot control. System 2 of Hume implements value-Guided thinking by extending a Vision-Language-Action Model backbone with a novel value-query head to estimate the state-action value of predicted actions. The value-guided thinking is conducted by repeat sampling multiple action candidates and selecting one according to state-action value. System 1 of Hume is a lightweight reactive visuomotor policy that takes System 2 selected action and performs cascaded action denoising for dexterous robot control. At deployment time, System 2 performs value-guided thinking at a low frequency while System 1 asynchronously receives the System 2 selected action candidate and predicts fluid actions in real time. We show that Hume outperforms the existing state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action models across multiple simulation benchmark and real-robot deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[AnchorAttention: Difference-Aware Sparse Attention with Stripe Granularity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23520v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) with extended context lengths face significant computational challenges during the pre-filling phase, primarily due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention. Existing methods typically employ dynamic pattern matching and block-sparse low-level implementations. However, their reliance on local information for pattern identification fails to capture global contexts, and the coarse granularity of blocks leads to persistent internal sparsity, resulting in suboptimal accuracy and efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{AnchorAttention}, a difference-aware, dynamic sparse attention mechanism that efficiently identifies critical attention regions at a finer stripe granularity while adapting to global contextual information, achieving superior speed and accuracy. AnchorAttention comprises three key components: (1) \textbf{Pattern-based Anchor Computation}, leveraging the commonalities present across all inputs to rapidly compute a set of near-maximum scores as the anchor; (2) \textbf{Difference-aware Stripe Sparsity Identification}, performing difference-aware comparisons with the anchor to quickly obtain discrete coordinates of significant regions in a stripe-like sparsity pattern; (3) \textbf{Fine-grained Sparse Computation}, replacing the traditional contiguous KV block loading approach with simultaneous discrete KV position loading to maximize sparsity rates while preserving full hardware computational potential. With its finer-grained sparsity strategy, \textbf{AnchorAttention} achieves higher sparsity rates at the same recall level, significantly reducing computation time. Compared to previous state-of-the-art methods, at a text length of 128k, it achieves a speedup of 1.44$\times$ while maintaining higher recall rates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Logically Sound Natural Language Reasoning with Logic-Enhanced Language Model Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16081v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as general-purpose reasoners, particularly in agentic contexts. However, their outputs remain prone to mathematical and logical errors. This is especially challenging in open-ended tasks, where unstructured outputs lack explicit ground truth and may contain subtle inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Logic-Enhanced Language Model Agents (LELMA), a framework that integrates LLMs with formal logic to enable validation and refinement of natural language reasoning. LELMA comprises three components: an LLM-Reasoner, an LLM-Translator, and a Solver, and employs autoformalization to translate reasoning into logic representations, which are then used to assess logical validity. Using game-theoretic scenarios such as the Prisoner's Dilemma as testbeds, we highlight the limitations of both less capable (Gemini 1.0 Pro) and advanced (GPT-4o) models in generating logically sound reasoning. LELMA achieves high accuracy in error detection and improves reasoning correctness via self-refinement, particularly in GPT-4o. The study also highlights challenges in autoformalization accuracy and in evaluation of inherently ambiguous open-ended reasoning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code: https://github.com/dicelab-rhul/LELMA</p></details> |
| **[Hijacking Large Language Models via Adversarial In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09948v3)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm leveraging LLMs for specific downstream tasks by utilizing labeled examples as demonstrations (demos) in the preconditioned prompts. Despite its promising performance, crafted adversarial attacks pose a notable threat to the robustness of LLMs. Existing attacks are either easy to detect, require a trigger in user input, or lack specificity towards ICL. To address these issues, this work introduces a novel transferable prompt injection attack against ICL, aiming to hijack LLMs to generate the target output or elicit harmful responses. In our threat model, the hacker acts as a model publisher who leverages a gradient-based prompt search method to learn and append imperceptible adversarial suffixes to the in-context demos via prompt injection. We also propose effective defense strategies using a few shots of clean demos, enhancing the robustness of LLMs during ICL. Extensive experimental results across various classification and jailbreak tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack and defense strategies. This work highlights the significant security vulnerabilities of LLMs during ICL and underscores the need for further in-depth studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[VAU-R1: Advancing Video Anomaly Understanding via Reinforcement Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23504v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU) is essential for applications such as smart cities, security surveillance, and disaster alert systems, yet remains challenging due to its demand for fine-grained spatio-temporal perception and robust reasoning under ambiguity. Despite advances in anomaly detection, existing methods often lack interpretability and struggle to capture the causal and contextual aspects of abnormal events. This limitation is further compounded by the absence of comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating reasoning ability in anomaly scenarios. To address both challenges, we introduce VAU-R1, a data-efficient framework built upon Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which enhances anomaly reasoning through Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT). Besides, we propose VAU-Bench, the first Chain-of-Thought benchmark tailored for video anomaly reasoning, featuring multiple-choice QA, detailed rationales, temporal annotations, and descriptive captions. Empirical results show that VAU-R1 significantly improves question answering accuracy, temporal grounding, and reasoning coherence across diverse contexts. Together, our method and benchmark establish a strong foundation for interpretable and reasoning-aware video anomaly understanding. Our code is available at https://github.com/GVCLab/VAU-R1.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Language Models Challenge CNNS in Medical Image Analysis?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23503v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a multimodal AI framework designed for precisely classifying medical diagnostic images. Utilizing publicly available datasets, the proposed system compares the strengths of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and different large language models (LLMs). This in-depth comparative analysis highlights key differences in diagnostic performance, execution efficiency, and environmental impacts. Model evaluation was based on accuracy, F1-score, average execution time, average energy consumption, and estimated $CO_2$ emission. The findings indicate that although CNN-based models can outperform various multimodal techniques that incorporate both images and contextual information, applying additional filtering on top of LLMs can lead to substantial performance gains. These findings highlight the transformative potential of multimodal AI systems to enhance the reliability, efficiency, and scalability of medical diagnostics in clinical settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identity resolution of software metadata using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23500v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software is an essential component of research. However, little attention has been paid to it compared with that paid to research data. Recently, there has been an increase in efforts to acknowledge and highlight the importance of software in research activities. Structured metadata from platforms like bio.tools, Bioconductor, and Galaxy ToolShed offers valuable insights into research software in the Life Sciences. Although originally intended to support discovery and integration, this metadata can be repurposed for large-scale analysis of software practices. However, its quality and completeness vary across platforms, reflecting diverse documentation practices. To gain a comprehensive view of software development and sustainability, consolidating this metadata is necessary, but requires robust mechanisms to address its heterogeneity and scale. This article presents an evaluation of instruction-tuned large language models for the task of software metadata identity resolution, a critical step in assembling a cohesive collection of research software. Such a collection is the reference component for the Software Observatory at OpenEBench, a platform that aggregates metadata to monitor the FAIRness of research software in the Life Sciences. We benchmarked multiple models against a human-annotated gold standard, examined their behavior on ambiguous cases, and introduced an agreement-based proxy for high-confidence automated decisions. The proxy achieved high precision and statistical robustness, while also highlighting the limitations of current models and the broader challenges of automating semantic judgment in FAIR-aligned software metadata across registries and repositories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Poison Large Language Models for Downstream Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13459v3)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has marked significant achievements in language processing and reasoning capabilities. Despite their advancements, LLMs face vulnerabilities to data poisoning attacks, where the adversary inserts backdoor triggers into training data to manipulate outputs. This work further identifies additional security risks in LLMs by designing a new data poisoning attack tailored to exploit the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) process. We propose a novel gradient-guided backdoor trigger learning (GBTL) algorithm to identify adversarial triggers efficiently, ensuring an evasion of detection by conventional defenses while maintaining content integrity. Through experimental validation across various language model tasks, including sentiment analysis, domain generation, and question answering, our poisoning strategy demonstrates a high success rate in compromising various LLMs' outputs. We further propose two defense strategies against data poisoning attacks, including in-context learning (ICL) and continuous learning (CL), which effectively rectify the behavior of LLMs and significantly reduce the decline in performance. Our work highlights the significant security risks present during SFT of LLMs and the necessity of safeguarding LLMs against data poisoning attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding In-Context Machine Translation for Low-Resource Languages: A Case Study on Manchu](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11862v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context machine translation (MT) with large language models (LLMs) is a promising approach for low-resource MT, as it can readily take advantage of linguistic resources such as grammar books and dictionaries. Such resources are usually selectively integrated into the prompt so that LLMs can directly perform translation without any specific training, via their in-context learning capability (ICL). However, the relative importance of each type of resource, e.g., dictionary, grammar book, and retrieved parallel examples, is not entirely clear. To address this gap, this study systematically investigates how each resource and its quality affect the translation performance, with the Manchu language as our case study. To remove any prior knowledge of Manchu encoded in the LLM parameters and single out the effect of ICL, we also experiment with an enciphered version of Manchu texts. Our results indicate that high-quality dictionaries and good parallel examples are very helpful, while grammars hardly help. In a follow-up study, we showcase a promising application of in-context MT: parallel data augmentation as a way to bootstrap a conventional MT model. When monolingual data abound, generating synthetic parallel data through in-context MT offers a pathway to mitigate data scarcity and build effective and efficient low-resource neural MT systems.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |

This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for evaluating and improving LLM response consistency, making three key contributions. First, we propose a novel Position-Weighted Consistency (PWC) score that captures both the importance of early-stage stability and recovery patterns in multi-turn interactions. Second, we present a carefully curated benchmark dataset spanning diverse domains and difficulty levels, specifically designed to evaluate LLM consistency under various challenging follow-up scenarios. Third, we introduce Confidence-Aware Response Generation (CARG), a framework that significantly improves response stability by incorporating model confidence signals into the generation process. Empirical results demonstrate that CARG significantly improves response stability without sacrificing accuracy, underscoring its potential for reliable LLM deployment in critical applications.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

Driven by the rapid progress in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), this field has witnessed substantial growth, bringing both new opportunities and unique challenges. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in autoformalization from both mathematical and LLM-centric perspectives. We examine how autoformalization is applied across various mathematical domains and levels of difficulty, and analyze the end-to-end workflow from data preprocessing to model design and evaluation. We further explore the emerging role of autoformalization in enhancing the verifiability of LLM-generated outputs, highlighting its potential to improve both the trustworthiness and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Finally, we summarize key open-source models and datasets supporting current research, and discuss open challenges and promising future directions for the field.</p></details> |  |

Although large vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in caption generation, existing benchmarks inadequately address fine-grained evaluation, particularly in capturing spatial-temporal details critical for video generation. To address this gap, we introduce the Fine-grained Video Caption Evaluation Benchmark (VCapsBench), the first large-scale fine-grained benchmark comprising 5,677 (5K+) videos and 109,796 (100K+) question-answer pairs. These QA-pairs are systematically annotated across 21 fine-grained dimensions (e.g., camera movement, and shot type) that are empirically proven critical for text-to-video generation. We further introduce three metrics (Accuracy (AR), Inconsistency Rate (IR), Coverage Rate (CR)), and an automated evaluation pipeline leveraging large language model (LLM) to verify caption quality via contrastive QA-pairs analysis. By providing actionable insights for caption optimization, our benchmark can advance the development of robust text-to-video models.

However, they often exhibit overthinking -- performing unnecessary reasoning steps even after arriving at the correct answer. Prior work has largely focused on qualitative analyses of overthinking through sample-based observations of long CoTs. In contrast, we present a quantitative analysis of overthinking from the perspective of self-doubt, characterized by excessive token usage devoted to re-verifying already-correct answer. We find that self-doubt significantly contributes to overthinking. In response, we introduce a simple and effective prompting method to reduce the model's over-reliance on input questions, thereby avoiding self-doubt. Specifically, we first prompt the model to question the validity of the input question, and then respond concisely based on the outcome of that evaluation. Experiments on three mathematical reasoning tasks and four datasets with missing premises demonstrate that our method substantially reduces answer length and yields significant improvements across nearly all datasets upon 4 widely-used RLLMs. Further analysis demonstrates that our method effectively minimizes the number of reasoning steps and reduces self-doubt.</p></details> |  |

Recently, these questions have also served as benchmarks for evaluating large language models' (LLMs) neurosurgical knowledge. This study aims to assess the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs on neurosurgery board-like questions and to evaluate their robustness to the inclusion of distractor statements. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted using 28 large language models. These models were tested on 2,904 neurosurgery board examination questions derived from the CNS-SANS. Additionally, the study introduced a distraction framework to assess the fragility of these models. The framework incorporated simple, irrelevant distractor statements containing polysemous words with clinical meanings used in non-clinical contexts to determine the extent to which such distractions degrade model performance on standard medical benchmarks. 6 of the 28 tested LLMs achieved board-passing outcomes, with the top-performing models scoring over 15.7% above the passing threshold. When exposed to distractions, accuracy across various model architectures was significantly reduced-by as much as 20.4%-with one model failing that had previously passed. Both general-purpose and medical open-source models experienced greater performance declines compared to proprietary variants when subjected to the added distractors. While current LLMs demonstrate an impressive ability to answer neurosurgery board-like exam questions, their performance is markedly vulnerable to extraneous, distracting information. These findings underscore the critical need for developing novel mitigation strategies aimed at bolstering LLM resilience against in-text distractions, particularly for safe and effective clinical deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 3 main figures, 3 supplemental figures</p></details> |

Collecting such instructions is crucial for evaluating and mitigating over-refusals, but existing instruction curation methods, like manual creation or instruction rewriting, either lack scalability or fail to produce sufficiently diverse and effective refusal-inducing prompts. To address these limitations, we introduce EVOREFUSE, a prompt optimization approach that generates diverse pseudo-malicious instructions consistently eliciting confident refusals across LLMs. EVOREFUSE employs an evolutionary algorithm exploring the instruction space in more diverse directions than existing methods via mutation strategies and recombination, and iteratively evolves seed instructions to maximize evidence lower bound on LLM refusal probability. Using EVOREFUSE, we create two novel datasets: EVOREFUSE-TEST, a benchmark of 582 pseudo-malicious instructions that outperforms the next-best benchmark with 140.41% higher average refusal triggering rate across 9 LLMs, 34.86% greater lexical diversity, and 40.03% improved LLM response confidence scores; and EVOREFUSE-ALIGN, which provides 3,000 pseudo-malicious instructions with responses for supervised and preference-based alignment training. LLAMA3.1-8B-INSTRUCT supervisedly fine-tuned on EVOREFUSE-ALIGN achieves up to 14.31% fewer over-refusals than models trained on the second-best alignment dataset, without compromising safety. Our analysis with EVOREFUSE-TEST reveals models trigger over-refusals by overly focusing on sensitive keywords while ignoring broader context.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating their effectiveness and further suggesting optimization opportunities often rely on high-quality tests to demonstrate the performance bottlenecks presented in the program. However, existing approaches rely on a limited set of hand-curated inputs or LLM-generated uninteresting length-stressing tests, failing to reveal more nuanced optimization opportunities. We present WEDGE, a framework for generating performance-stressing input given the program under test. WEDGE synthesizes explicit performance-characterizing constraints in the form of branch conditions to partition the programs' execution space into performance-specific regions. When integrated with the coverage-guided fuzzer, reaching different regions introduces explicit rewards for test generation to explore inefficient implementations. Our evaluation shows that WEDGE introduces a significant slowdown compared to the tests in CodeContests and those claimed to be optimized by existing approaches. From the utility perspective, integrating our tests substantially improves the existing code optimization approaches that rely on test-driven execution feedback. We release PERFFORGE, the performance tests generated by WEDGE, to benchmark future approaches for efficient code generation at https://github.com/UChiSeclab/perfforge.</p></details> | 30 pages, 3 figures |

Comparing and selecting appropriate LLMs for specific tasks requires systematic evaluation methods, as models exhibit varying capabilities across different domains. However, finding suitable benchmarks is difficult given the many available options. This complexity not only increases the risk of benchmark misuse and misinterpretation but also demands substantial effort from LLM users, seeking the most suitable benchmarks for their specific needs. To address these issues, we introduce \texttt{BenchmarkCards}, an intuitive and validated documentation framework that standardizes critical benchmark attributes such as objectives, methodologies, data sources, and limitations. Through user studies involving benchmark creators and users, we show that \texttt{BenchmarkCards} can simplify benchmark selection and enhance transparency, facilitating informed decision-making in evaluating LLMs. Data & Code: https://github.com/SokolAnn/BenchmarkCards</p></details> |  |

However, traditional agent planning approaches adopt a "flood irrigation" methodology that indiscriminately injects gold trajectories, external feedback, and domain knowledge into agent models. This practice overlooks the fundamental human cognitive principle of situational self-awareness during decision-making-the ability to dynamically assess situational demands and strategically employ resources during decision-making. We propose agentic knowledgeable self-awareness to address this gap, a novel paradigm enabling LLM-based agents to autonomously regulate knowledge utilization. Specifically, we propose KnowSelf, a data-centric approach that applies agents with knowledgeable self-awareness like humans. Concretely, we devise a heuristic situation judgement criterion to mark special tokens on the agent's self-explored trajectories for collecting training data. Through a two-stage training process, the agent model can switch between different situations by generating specific special tokens, achieving optimal planning effects with minimal costs. Our experiments demonstrate that KnowSelf can outperform various strong baselines on different tasks and models with minimal use of external knowledge.

Despite the recent advances in LLM selection, a fundamental research question largely remains nascent: how can we model the dynamic behaviors of LLMs during fine-tuning, thereby enhancing our understanding of their generalization performance across diverse downstream tasks? In this work, we propose a novel theoretical framework that provides a proper lens to assess the generalization capabilities of LLMs, thereby enabling accurate and efficient LLM selection for downstream applications. In particular, we first derive a PAC-Bayesian Generalization Bound that unveils fine-tuning dynamics of LLMs and then introduce LENSLLM, a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)-based Rectified Scaling Model that enables accurate performance predictions across diverse tasks while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive empirical results on 3 large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves up to 91.1% accuracy and reduces up to 88.5% computational cost in LLM selection, outperforming 5 state-of-the-art methods. We open-source our proposed LENSLLM model and corresponding results at LensLLM.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML'2025</p></details> |

However, the security issues associated with these models are becoming increasingly severe. Jailbreaking attacks, as an important method for detecting vulnerabilities in LLMs, have been explored by researchers who attempt to induce these models to generate harmful content through various attack methods. Nevertheless, existing jailbreaking methods face numerous limitations, such as excessive query counts, limited coverage of jailbreak modalities, low attack success rates, and simplistic evaluation methods. To overcome these constraints, this paper proposes a multimodal jailbreaking method: JMLLM. This method integrates multiple strategies to perform comprehensive jailbreak attacks across text, visual, and auditory modalities. Additionally, we contribute a new and comprehensive dataset for multimodal jailbreaking research: TriJail, which includes jailbreak prompts for all three modalities. Experiments on the TriJail dataset and the benchmark dataset AdvBench, conducted on 13 popular LLMs, demonstrate advanced attack success rates and significant reduction in time overhead.</p></details> |  |

Although gradient boosting machines and some recent deep models achieve strong performance on tabular data, they often lack interpretability. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities to generate human-like reasoning and explanations, but remain under-performed for tabular data prediction. In this paper, we propose a new approach that leverages reasoning-based LLMs, trained using reinforcement learning, to perform more accurate and explainable predictions on tabular data. Our method introduces custom reward functions that guide the model not only toward high prediction accuracy but also toward human-understandable reasons for its predictions. Experimental results show that our model achieves promising performance on financial benchmark datasets, outperforming most existing LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Guiding Fine-Grained Emotion Extraction from Mobile App Reviews](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23452v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Opinion mining plays a vital role in analysing user feedback and extracting insights from textual data. While most research focuses on sentiment polarity (e.g., positive, negative, neutral), fine-grained emotion classification in app reviews remains underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by identifying and addressing the challenges and limitations in fine-grained emotion analysis in the context of app reviews. Our study adapts Plutchik's emotion taxonomy to app reviews by developing a structured annotation framework and dataset. Through an iterative human annotation process, we define clear annotation guidelines and document key challenges in emotion classification. Additionally, we evaluate the feasibility of automating emotion annotation using large language models, assessing their cost-effectiveness and agreement with human-labelled data. Our findings reveal that while large language models significantly reduce manual effort and maintain substantial agreement with human annotators, full automation remains challenging due to the complexity of emotional interpretation. This work contributes to opinion mining by providing structured guidelines, an annotated dataset, and insights for developing automated pipelines to capture the complexity of emotions in app reviews.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 33rd IEEE International Requirements Engineering 2025 conference</p></details> |

While previous studies have explored the application of MLLM for detecting out-of-context (OOC) misinformation, our empirical analysis reveals two persisting challenges of this paradigm. Evaluating the representative GPT-4o model on direct reasoning and evidence augmented reasoning, results indicate that MLLM struggle to capture the deeper relationships-specifically, cases in which the image and text are not directly connected but are associated through underlying semantic links. Moreover, noise in the evidence further impairs detection accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose CMIE, a novel OOC misinformation detection framework that incorporates a Coexistence Relationship Generation (CRG) strategy and an Association Scoring (AS) mechanism. CMIE identifies the underlying coexistence relationships between images and text, and selectively utilizes relevant evidence to enhance misinformation detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Our analysis reveals that existing hallucination detection methods struggle with detailed captions. We attribute this to the increasing reliance of MLLMs on their generated text, rather than the input image, as the sequence length grows. To address this issue, we propose a multiagent approach that leverages LLM-MLLM collaboration to correct given captions. Additionally, we introduce an evaluation framework and a benchmark dataset to facilitate the systematic analysis of detailed captions. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed evaluation method better aligns with human judgments of factuality than existing metrics and that existing approaches to improve the MLLM factuality may fall short in hyper-detailed image captioning tasks. In contrast, our proposed method significantly enhances the factual accuracy of captions, even improving those generated by GPT-4V. Finally, we highlight a limitation of VQA-centric benchmarking by demonstrating that an MLLM's performance on VQA benchmarks may not correlate with its ability to generate detailed image captions.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

However, traditional LLM fine-tuning approaches face significant challenges: they require large Floating Point (FP) computation, raising privacy concerns when handling sensitive data, and are impractical for resource-constrained edge devices. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques reduce trainable parameters, their reliance on floating-point arithmetic creates fundamental incompatibilities with edge hardware. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for on-device LLM fine-tuning that eliminates the need for floating-point operations in both inference and training, named GSQ-Tuning. At its core is the Group-Shared Exponents Integer format, which efficiently represents model parameters in integer format using shared exponents among parameter groups. When combined with LoRA-like adapters, this enables fully integer-based fine-tuning that is both memory and compute efficient. We demonstrate that our approach achieves accuracy comparable to BF16-based fine-tuning while significantly reducing 1.85x memory usage. Moreover, compared to FP8, our method can reduce 5x power consumption and 11x chip area with same performance, making large-scale model adaptation feasible on edge devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Findings of ACL 2025</p></details> |

However, enhancing reasoning abilities in LLMs, particularly via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), remains challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality preference data, which is labor-intensive to annotate and crucial for reward model (RM) finetuning. To alleviate this issue, we introduce CodePMP, a scalable preference model pretraining (PMP) pipeline that utilizes a large corpus of synthesized code-preference pairs from publicly available high-quality source code. CodePMP improves RM finetuning efficiency by pretraining preference models on large-scale synthesized code-preference pairs. We evaluate CodePMP on mathematical reasoning tasks (GSM8K, MATH) and logical reasoning tasks (ReClor, LogiQA2.0), consistently showing significant improvements in reasoning performance of LLMs and highlighting the importance of scalable preference model pretraining for efficient reward modeling.</p></details> | work in progress |

This study systematically compares reasoning LLMs with non-reasoning counterparts across machine translation and text summarization evaluation tasks. We evaluate eight models spanning state-of-the-art reasoning models (DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI o3), their distilled variants (8B-70B parameters), and equivalent non-reasoning LLMs. Experiments on WMT23 and SummEval benchmarks reveal architecture and task-dependent benefits: OpenAI o3-mini models show improved performance with increased reasoning on MT, while DeepSeek-R1 and generally underperforms compared to its non-reasoning variant except in summarization consistency evaluation. Correlation analysis demonstrates that reasoning token usage correlates with evaluation quality only in specific models, while almost all models generally allocate more reasoning tokens when identifying more quality issues. Distillation maintains reasonable performance up to 32B parameter models but degrades substantially at 8B scale. This work provides the first assessment of reasoning LLMs for NLG evaluation and comparison to non-reasoning models. We share our code to facilitate further research: https://github.com/NL2G/reasoning-eval.</p></details> |  |

Despite the pivotal role diversity plays in RL, its influence on LLM reasoning remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, this work presents a systematic investigation into the impact of diversity in RL-based training for LLM reasoning, and proposes a novel diversity-aware policy optimization method. Across evaluations on 12 LLMs, we observe a strong positive correlation between the solution diversity and Potential at k (a novel metric quantifying an LLM's reasoning potential) in high-performing models. This finding motivates our method to explicitly promote diversity during RL training. Specifically, we design a token-level diversity and reformulate it into a practical objective, then we selectively apply it to positive samples. Integrated into the R1-zero training framework, our method achieves a 3.5 percent average improvement across four mathematical reasoning benchmarks, while generating more diverse and robust solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[DELMAN: Dynamic Defense Against Large Language Model Jailbreaking with Model Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11647v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely applied in decision making, but their deployment is threatened by jailbreak attacks, where adversarial users manipulate model behavior to bypass safety measures. Existing defense mechanisms, such as safety fine-tuning and model editing, either require extensive parameter modifications or lack precision, leading to performance degradation on general tasks, which is unsuitable to post-deployment safety alignment. To address these challenges, we propose DELMAN (Dynamic Editing for LLMs JAilbreak DefeNse), a novel approach leveraging direct model editing for precise, dynamic protection against jailbreak attacks. DELMAN directly updates a minimal set of relevant parameters to neutralize harmful behaviors while preserving the model's utility. To avoid triggering a safe response in benign context, we incorporate KL-divergence regularization to ensure the updated model remains consistent with the original model when processing benign queries. Experimental results demonstrate that DELMAN outperforms baseline methods in mitigating jailbreak attacks while preserving the model's utility, and adapts seamlessly to new attack instances, providing a practical and efficient solution for post-deployment model protection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding and Mitigating Overrefusal in LLMs from an Unveiling Perspective of Safety Decision Boundary](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18325v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet they often refuse to answer legitimate queries-a phenomenon known as overrefusal. Overrefusal typically stems from over-conservative safety alignment, causing models to treat many reasonable prompts as potentially risky. To systematically understand this issue, we probe and leverage the models'safety decision boundaries to analyze and mitigate overrefusal. Our findings reveal that overrefusal is closely tied to misalignment at these boundary regions, where models struggle to distinguish subtle differences between benign and harmful content. Building on these insights, we present RASS, an automated framework for prompt generation and selection that strategically targets overrefusal prompts near the safety boundary. By harnessing steering vectors in the representation space, RASS efficiently identifies and curates boundary-aligned prompts, enabling more effective and targeted mitigation of overrefusal. This approach not only provides a more precise and interpretable view of model safety decisions but also seamlessly extends to multilingual scenarios.We have explored the safety decision boundaries of various LLMs and construct the MORBench evaluation set to facilitate robust assessment of model safety and helpfulness across multiple languages. Code and datasets will be released at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RASS-80D3.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have identified significant errors in the results presented in this paper, specifically in the evaluation sections concerning the DPO training of LLaMA2 and Qwen2.5, as well as in the representation space visualization section.

Existing methods for adapting LLMs to streaming rely either on expensive re-encoding or specialized architectures with limited scalability. This work identifies three key mismatches in adapting batch-oriented LLMs to streaming: (1) input-attention, (2) output-attention, and (3) position-ID mismatches. While it is commonly assumed that the latter two mismatches require frequent re-encoding, our analysis reveals that only the input-attention mismatch significantly impacts performance, indicating re-encoding outputs is largely unnecessary. To better understand this discrepancy with the common assumption, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of the impact of position encoding on LLMs in streaming, showing that preserving relative positions within source and target contexts is more critical than maintaining absolute order. Motivated by the above analysis, we introduce a group position encoding paradigm built on batch architectures to enhance consistency between streaming and batch modes. Extensive experiments on cross-lingual and cross-modal tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. Our method requires no architectural modifications, exhibits strong generalization in both streaming and batch modes.

Prior work has utilized predefined sets of rules or principles to steer the behavior of models (Bai et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2023). However, these principles tend to be generic, making it challenging to adapt them to each individual input query or context. In this work, we present Situated-PRInciples (SPRI), a framework requiring minimal or no human effort that is designed to automatically generate guiding principles in real-time for each input query and utilize them to align each response. We evaluate SPRI on three tasks, and show that 1) SPRI can derive principles in a complex domain-specific task that leads to on-par performance as expert-crafted ones; 2) SPRI-generated principles lead to instance-specific rubrics that outperform prior LLM-as-a-judge frameworks; 3) using SPRI to generate synthetic SFT data leads to substantial improvement on truthfulness.

| **[Risk-aware Direct Preference Optimization under Nested Risk Measure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20359v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When fine-tuning pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to align with human values and intentions, maximizing the estimated reward can lead to superior performance, but it also introduces potential risks due to deviations from the reference model's intended behavior. Most existing methods typically introduce KL divergence to constrain deviations between the trained model and the reference model; however, this may not be sufficient in certain applications that require tight risk control. In this paper, we introduce Risk-aware Direct Preference Optimization (Ra-DPO), a novel approach that incorporates risk-awareness by employing a class of nested risk measures. This approach formulates a constrained risk-aware advantage function maximization problem and then converts the Bradley-Terry model into a token-level representation. The objective function maximizes the likelihood of the policy while suppressing the deviation between a trained model and the reference model using a sequential risk ratio, thereby enhancing the model's risk-awareness. Experimental results across three open-source datasets: IMDb Dataset, Anthropic HH Dataset, and AlpacaEval, demonstrate the proposed method's superior performance in balancing alignment performance and model drift.

| **[DynaCode: A Dynamic Complexity-Aware Code Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models in Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10452v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly improved their performance in code generation tasks. However, existing code benchmarks remain static, consisting of fixed datasets with predefined problems. This makes them vulnerable to memorization during training, where LLMs recall specific test cases instead of generalizing to new problems, leading to data contamination and unreliable evaluation results. To address these issues, we introduce DynaCode, a dynamic, complexity-aware benchmark that overcomes the limitations of static datasets. DynaCode evaluates LLMs systematically using a complexity-aware metric, incorporating both code complexity and call-graph structures. DynaCode achieves large-scale diversity, generating up to 189 million unique nested code problems across four distinct levels of code complexity, referred to as units, and 16 types of call graphs. Results on 12 latest LLMs show an average performance drop of 16.8% to 45.7% compared to MBPP+, a static code generation benchmark, with performance progressively decreasing as complexity increases. This demonstrates DynaCode's ability to effectively differentiate LLMs. Additionally, by leveraging call graphs, we gain insights into LLM behavior, particularly their preference for handling subfunction interactions within nested code. Our benchmark and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/HWH-2000/DynaCode.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 13 figures.

Here, we propose a sample-efficient human evaluation method for LLMs based on the principle of MAximum Discrepancy (MAD) Competition. Our method automatically and adaptively selects a compact set of input instructions that maximize semantic discrepancy between pairs of LLM responses. Human evaluators then perform three-alternative forced choices on these paired responses, which are aggregated into a global ranking using Elo rating. We apply our approach to compare eight widely used LLMs across four tasks: scientific knowledge understanding, mathematical reasoning, creative and functional writing, and code generation and explanation. Experimental results show that our sample-efficient evaluation method recovers "gold-standard" model rankings with a handful of MAD-selected instructions, reveals respective strengths and weaknesses of each LLM, and offers nuanced insights to guide future LLM development.

While SWE-bench and its variants have become standard in this domain, they suffer from key limitations: they have not been updated since their initial releases, cover a narrow set of repositories, and depend heavily on manual effort for instance construction and environment setup. These factors hinder scalability and introduce risks of overfitting and data contamination. In this work, we present \textbf{SWE-bench-Live}, a \textit{live-updatable} benchmark designed to overcome these challenges. Our initial release consists of 1,319 tasks derived from real GitHub issues created since 2024, spanning 93 repositories. Each task is accompanied by a dedicated Docker image to ensure reproducible execution. Central to our benchmark is \method, an automated curation pipeline that streamlines the entire process from instance creation to environment setup, removing manual bottlenecks and enabling scalability and continuous updates. We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art agent frameworks and LLMs on SWE-bench-Live, revealing a substantial performance gap compared to static benchmarks like SWE-bench, even under controlled evaluation conditions. To better understand this discrepancy, we perform detailed analyses across repository origin, issue recency, and task difficulty.

However, in many real scenarios, the source tokens arrive in a streaming manner and simultaneous machine translation (SiMT) is required, then the efficiency and performance of decoder-only LLMs are significantly limited by their auto-regressive nature. To enable LLMs to achieve high-quality SiMT as efficiently as offline translation, we propose a novel paradigm that includes constructing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data for SiMT, along with new training and inference strategies. To replicate the token input/output stream in SiMT, the source and target tokens are rearranged into an interleaved sequence, separated by special tokens according to varying latency requirements. This enables powerful LLMs to learn read and write operations adaptively, based on varying latency prompts, while still maintaining efficient auto-regressive decoding. Experimental results show that, even with limited SFT data, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across various SiMT benchmarks, and preserves the original abilities of offline translation. Moreover, our approach generalizes well to document-level SiMT setting without requiring specific fine-tuning, even beyond the offline translation model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera ready version for ACL 2025 Findings</p></details> |

The recent emergence of multimodal reasoning models has significantly transformed the landscape of solving complex tasks. Although such models have achieved notable success in mathematics and science, their application to medical domains remains underexplored. In this work, we propose \textit{MedE$^2$}, a two-stage post-training pipeline that elicits and then enhances multimodal reasoning for medical domains. In Stage-I, we fine-tune models using 2,000 text-only data samples containing precisely orchestrated reasoning demonstrations to elicit reasoning behaviors. In Stage-II, we further enhance the model's reasoning capabilities using 1,500 rigorously curated multimodal medical cases, aligning model reasoning outputs with our proposed multimodal medical reasoning preference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of \textit{MedE$^2$} in improving the reasoning performance of medical multimodal models. Notably, models trained with \textit{MedE$^2$} consistently outperform baselines across multiple medical multimodal benchmarks. Additional validation on larger models and under inference-time scaling further confirms the robustness and practical utility of our approach.</p></details> |  |

However, beyond general medical knowledge from open-ended datasets, clinical case-based knowledge is also critical for effective medical reasoning, as it provides context grounded in real-world patient experiences.Motivated by this, we propose Experience Retrieval-Augmentation ExpRAG framework based on Electronic Health Record(EHR), aiming to offer the relevant context from other patients' discharge reports. ExpRAG performs retrieval through a coarse-to-fine process, utilizing an EHR-based report ranker to efficiently identify similar patients, followed by an experience retriever to extract task-relevant content for enhanced medical reasoning.To evaluate ExpRAG, we introduce DischargeQA, a clinical QA dataset with 1,280 discharge-related questions across diagnosis, medication, and instruction tasks. Each problem is generated using EHR data to ensure realistic and challenging scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ExpRAG consistently outperforms a text-based ranker, achieving an average relative improvement of 5.2%, highlighting the importance of case-based knowledge for medical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we propose DoctorRAG, a RAG framework that emulates doctor-like reasoning by integrating both explicit clinical knowledge and implicit case-based experience. DoctorRAG enhances retrieval precision by first allocating conceptual tags for queries and knowledge sources, together with a hybrid retrieval mechanism from both relevant knowledge and patient. In addition, a Med-TextGrad module using multi-agent textual gradients is integrated to ensure that the final output adheres to the retrieved knowledge and patient query. Comprehensive experiments on multilingual, multitask datasets demonstrate that DoctorRAG significantly outperforms strong baseline RAG models and gains improvements from iterative refinements.

Despite these promising developments in the general domain, their translation to medical imaging remains limited. Current medical reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) methods predominantly focus on close-ended VQA, thereby restricting the model's ability to engage in world knowledge retrieval and flexible task adaptation. More critically, these methods fall short of addressing the critical clinical demand for open-ended, reasoning-intensive decision-making. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{MedCCO}, the first multimodal reinforcement learning framework tailored for medical VQA that unifies close-ended and open-ended data within a curriculum-driven RFT paradigm. Specifically, MedCCO is initially fine-tuned on a diverse set of close-ended medical VQA tasks to establish domain-grounded reasoning capabilities, and is then progressively adapted to open-ended tasks to foster deeper knowledge enhancement and clinical interpretability. We validate MedCCO across eight challenging medical VQA benchmarks, spanning both close-ended and open-ended settings. Experimental results show that MedCCO consistently enhances performance and generalization, achieving a 11.4\% accuracy gain across three in-domain tasks, and a 5.7\% improvement on five out-of-domain benchmarks. These findings highlight the promise of curriculum-guided RL in advancing robust, clinically-relevant reasoning in medical multimodal language models.</p></details> |  |

A 3D Medical Benchmark for Tumor-centric Visual Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18915v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in various 2D visual tasks, yet their readiness for 3D clinical diagnosis remains unclear due to stringent demands for recognition precision, reasoning ability, and domain knowledge. To systematically evaluate these dimensions, we present DeepTumorVQA, a diagnostic visual question answering (VQA) benchmark targeting abdominal tumors in CT scans. It comprises 9,262 CT volumes (3.7M slices) from 17 public datasets, with 395K expert-level questions spanning four categories: Recognition, Measurement, Visual Reasoning, and Medical Reasoning. DeepTumorVQA introduces unique challenges, including small tumor detection and clinical reasoning across 3D anatomy. Benchmarking four advanced VLMs (RadFM, M3D, Merlin, CT-CHAT), we find current models perform adequately on measurement tasks but struggle with lesion recognition and reasoning, and are still not meeting clinical needs. Two key insights emerge: (1) large-scale multimodal pretraining plays a crucial role in DeepTumorVQA testing performance, making RadFM stand out among all VLMs. (2) Our dataset exposes critical differences in VLM components, where proper image preprocessing and design of vision modules significantly affect 3D perception. To facilitate medical multimodal research, we have released DeepTumorVQA as a rigorous benchmark: https://github.com/Schuture/DeepTumorVQA.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 datasets&benchmarks track submission</p></details> |

However, prompting-based methods often remain shallow and unstable, while fine-tuned medical LLMs suffer from poor generalization under distribution shifts and limited adaptability to unseen clinical scenarios. To address these limitations, we present TAGS, a test-time framework that combines a broadly capable generalist with a domain-specific specialist to offer complementary perspectives without any model fine-tuning or parameter updates. To support this generalist-specialist reasoning process, we introduce two auxiliary modules: a hierarchical retrieval mechanism that provides multi-scale exemplars by selecting examples based on both semantic and rationale-level similarity, and a reliability scorer that evaluates reasoning consistency to guide final answer aggregation. TAGS achieves strong performance across nine MedQA benchmarks, boosting GPT-4o accuracy by 13.8%, DeepSeek-R1 by 16.8%, and improving a vanilla 7B model from 14.1% to 23.9%. These results surpass several fine-tuned medical LLMs, without any parameter updates. The code will be available at https://github.com/JianghaoWu/TAGS.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages including references, 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[WiNGPT-3.0 Technical Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17387v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant limitations, notably in structured, interpretable, and verifiable medical reasoning, alongside practical deployment challenges related to computational resources and data privacy. This report focused on the development of WiNGPT-3.0, the 32-billion parameter LLMs, engineered with the objective of enhancing its capacity for medical reasoning and exploring its potential for effective integration within healthcare IT infrastructures. The broader aim is to advance towards clinically applicable models. The approach involved a multi-stage training pipeline tailored for general, medical, and clinical reasoning. This pipeline incorporated supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), leveraging curated Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) datasets, auxiliary reward models, and an evidence-based diagnostic chain simulation. WiNGPT-3.0 demonstrated strong performance: specific model variants achieved scores of 66.6 on MedCalc and 87.1 on MedQA-USMLE. Furthermore, targeted training improved performance on a clinical reasoning task from a baseline score of 58.1 to 62.5. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning, even when applied with a limited dataset of only a few thousand examples, can enhance medical reasoning accuracy. Crucially, this demonstration of RL's efficacy with limited data and computation paves the way for more trustworthy and practically deployable LLMs within clinical workflows and health information infrastructures.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present ChestX-Reasoner, a radiology diagnosis MLLM designed to leverage process supervision mined directly from clinical reports, reflecting the step-by-step reasoning followed by radiologists. We construct a large dataset by extracting and refining reasoning chains from routine radiology reports. Our two-stage training framework combines supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning guided by process rewards to better align model reasoning with clinical standards. We introduce RadRBench-CXR, a comprehensive benchmark featuring 59K visual question answering samples with 301K clinically validated reasoning steps, and propose RadRScore, a metric evaluating reasoning factuality, completeness, and effectiveness. ChestX-Reasoner outperforms existing medical and general-domain MLLMs in both diagnostic accuracy and reasoning ability, achieving 16%, 5.9%, and 18% improvements in reasoning ability compared to the best medical MLLM, the best general MLLM, and its base model, respectively, as well as 3.3%, 24%, and 27% improvements in outcome accuracy. All resources are open-sourced to facilitate further research in medical reasoning MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disentangling Reasoning and Knowledge in Medical Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11462v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) aims to emulate clinicians' diagnostic thinking, but current benchmarks such as MedQA-USMLE, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA often mix reasoning with factual recall. We address this by separating 11 biomedical QA benchmarks into reasoning- and knowledge-focused subsets using a PubMedBERT classifier that reaches 81 percent accuracy, comparable to human performance. Our analysis shows that only 32.8 percent of questions require complex reasoning. We evaluate biomedical models (HuatuoGPT-o1, MedReason, m1) and general-domain models (DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini, Qwen3), finding consistent gaps between knowledge and reasoning performance. For example, m1 scores 60.5 on knowledge but only 47.1 on reasoning. In adversarial tests where models are misled with incorrect initial reasoning, biomedical models degrade sharply, while larger or RL-trained general models show more robustness. To address this, we train BioMed-R1 using fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on reasoning-heavy examples. It achieves the strongest performance among similarly sized models. Further gains may come from incorporating clinical case reports and training with adversarial and backtracking scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Method for the Architecture of a Medical Vertical Large Language Model Based on Deepseek R1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00025v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, despite foundation models like DeepSeek-R1 and ChatGPT demonstrating significant capabilities in general tasks, professional knowledge barriers, computational resource requirements, and deployment environment limitations have severely hindered their application in actual medical scenarios. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient lightweight medical vertical large language model architecture method, systematically solving the lightweight problem of medical large models from three dimensions: knowledge acquisition, model compression, and computational optimization. At the knowledge acquisition level, a knowledge transfer pipeline is designed from the fine-tuned DeepSeek-R1-Distill-70B teacher model to the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B student model, and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technology is adopted to precisely adjust key attention layers. At the model compression level, compression techniques including 4-bit weight quantization are implemented while preserving the core representation ability for medical reasoning. At the computational optimization level, inference optimization techniques such as Flash Attention acceleration and continuous batching are integrated, and a professional prompt template system is constructed to adapt to different types of medical problems. Experimental results on medical question-answering datasets show that the method proposed in this paper maintains professional accuracy while reducing memory consumption by 64.7\% and inference latency by 12.4\%, providing an effective solution for the application of medical large models in resource-constrained environments such as edge computing devices.</p></details> | 14 pages, 1 figures |
| **[Med-R1: Reinforcement Learning for Generalizable Medical Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13939v4)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in natural image reasoning, yet their potential in medical imaging remains underexplored. Medical vision-language tasks demand precise understanding and clinically coherent answers, which are difficult to achieve due to the complexity of medical data and the scarcity of high-quality expert annotations. These challenges limit the effectiveness of conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategies that work well in general domains. To address these challenges, we propose Med-R1, a reinforcement learning (RL)-enhanced vision-language model designed to improve generalization and reliability in medical reasoning. Built on the DeepSeek strategy, Med-R1 adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to encourage reward-guided learning beyond static annotations. We comprehensively evaluate Med-R1 across eight distinct medical imaging modalities. Med-R1 achieves a 29.94% improvement in average accuracy over its base model Qwen2-VL-2B, and even outperforms Qwen2-VL-72B-a model with 36x more parameters. To assess cross-task generalization, we further evaluate Med-R1 on five question types. Med-R1 outperforms Qwen2-VL-2B by 32.06% in question-type generalization, also surpassing Qwen2-VL-72B. We further explore the thinking process in Med-R1, a crucial component for the success of Deepseek-R1. Our results show that omitting intermediate rationales (No-Thinking-Med-R1) not only improves in-domain and cross-domain generalization with less training, but also challenges the assumption that more reasoning always helps. These findings suggest that in medical VQA, it is not reasoning itself, but its quality and domain alignment, that determine effectiveness. Together, these results highlight that RL improves medical reasoning and generalization, enabling efficient and reliable VLMs for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[MediSee: Reasoning-based Pixel-level Perception in Medical Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11008v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite remarkable advancements in pixel-level medical image perception, existing methods are either limited to specific tasks or heavily rely on accurate bounding boxes or text labels as input prompts. However, the medical knowledge required for input is a huge obstacle for general public, which greatly reduces the universality of these methods. Compared with these domain-specialized auxiliary information, general users tend to rely on oral queries that require logical reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a novel medical vision task: Medical Reasoning Segmentation and Detection (MedSD), which aims to comprehend implicit queries about medical images and generate the corresponding segmentation mask and bounding box for the target object. To accomplish this task, we first introduce a Multi-perspective, Logic-driven Medical Reasoning Segmentation and Detection (MLMR-SD) dataset, which encompasses a substantial collection of medical entity targets along with their corresponding reasoning. Furthermore, we propose MediSee, an effective baseline model designed for medical reasoning segmentation and detection. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can effectively address MedSD with implicit colloquial queries and outperform traditional medical referring segmentation methods.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

Existing LLMs often struggle with intricate medical terminology and the need for accurate clinical insights, leading to performance reduction when quantized for resource-constrained deployment. To address these issues, we propose Quantized Medical Tree of Thought (QM-ToT), a path-based reasoning framework. QM-ToT leverages a Tree of Thought (ToT) reasoning approach to decompose complex medical problems into manageable subtasks, coupled with evaluator assessment layers. This framework facilitates substantial performance improvements in INT4-quantized models on the challenging MedQAUSMLE dataset. Specifically, we demonstrate a remarkable accuracy increase from 34% to 50% for the LLaMA2-70b model and from 58.77% to 69.49% for LLaMA-3.1-8b. Besides, we also proposed an effect data distillation method based on ToT. Compared to the traditional distillation method, we achieved an improvement of 86. 27% while using only 3.9% of the data.This work, for the first time, showcases the potential of ToT to significantly enhance performance on complex biomedical tasks, establishing a crucial foundation for future advances in deploying high-performing quantized LLM in resource-limited medical settings.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Unlike mathematical reasoning, medical reasoning demands meticulous, verifiable thought processes to ensure reliability and accuracy. However, there is a notable lack of datasets that provide transparent, step-by-step reasoning to validate and enhance the medical reasoning ability of AI models. To bridge this gap, we introduce MedReason, a large-scale high-quality medical reasoning dataset designed to enable faithful and explainable medical problem-solving in large language models (LLMs). We utilize a structured medical knowledge graph (KG) to convert clinical QA pairs into logical chains of reasoning, or ``thinking paths'', which trace connections from question elements to answers via relevant KG entities. Each path is validated for consistency with clinical logic and evidence-based medicine. Our pipeline generates detailed reasoning for various medical questions from 7 medical datasets, resulting in a dataset of 32,682 question-answer pairs, each with detailed, step-by-step explanations. Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning with our dataset consistently boosts medical problem-solving capabilities, achieving significant gains of up to 7.7% for DeepSeek-Ditill-8B. Our top-performing model, MedReason-8B, outperforms the Huatuo-o1-8B, a state-of-the-art medical reasoning model, by up to 4.2% on the clinical benchmark MedBullets. We also engage medical professionals from diverse specialties to assess our dataset's quality, ensuring MedReason offers accurate and coherent medical reasoning.

This paper presents GMAI-VL-R1, a multimodal medical reasoning model enhanced by reinforcement learning (RL) to improve its reasoning abilities. Through iterative training, GMAI-VL-R1 optimizes decision-making, significantly boosting diagnostic accuracy and clinical support. We also develop a reasoning data synthesis method, generating step-by-step reasoning data via rejection sampling, which further enhances the model's generalization. Experimental results show that after RL training, GMAI-VL-R1 excels in tasks such as medical image diagnosis and visual question answering. While the model demonstrates basic memorization with supervised fine-tuning, RL is crucial for true generalization. Our work establishes new evaluation benchmarks and paves the way for future advancements in medical reasoning models.

However, its effectiveness in medical reasoning remains uncertain, as the medical domain fundamentally differs from mathematical tasks in terms of knowledge representation and decision-making processes. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of test-time scaling for medical reasoning and present m1, a simple yet effective approach that increases a model's medical reasoning capability at inference. Our evaluation across diverse medical tasks demonstrates that test-time scaling consistently enhances medical reasoning, enabling lightweight fine-tuned models under 10B parameters to establish new state-of-the-art performance, while our 32B model rivals previous 70B-scale medical LLMs. However, we identify an optimal reasoning token budget of approximately 4K, beyond which performance may degrade due to overthinking. Budget forcing, which extends test-time computation through iterative prompts, helps models double-check answers but does not necessarily improve the overall medical QA performance and, in some cases, even introduces errors into previously correct responses. Our case-by-case analysis identifies insufficient medical knowledge as a key bottleneck that prevents further performance gains through test-time scaling. We find that increasing data scale, improving data quality, and expanding model capacity consistently enhance medical knowledge grounding, enabling continued performance improvements, particularly on challenging medical benchmarks where smaller models reach saturation. These findings underscore fundamental differences between medical and mathematical reasoning in LLMs, highlighting that enriched medical knowledge, other than increased reasoning depth alone, is essential for realizing the benefits of test-time scaling.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages; 7 figures; Data, code, and models: https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/m1</p></details> |
| **[Medical Reasoning in LLMs: An In-Depth Analysis of DeepSeek R1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00016v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating large language models (LLMs) like DeepSeek R1 into healthcare requires rigorous evaluation of their reasoning alignment with clinical expertise. This study assesses DeepSeek R1's medical reasoning against expert patterns using 100 MedQA clinical cases. The model achieved 93% diagnostic accuracy, demonstrating systematic clinical judgment through differential diagnosis, guideline-based treatment selection, and integration of patient-specific factors. However, error analysis of seven incorrect cases revealed persistent limitations: anchoring bias, challenges reconciling conflicting data, insufficient exploration of alternatives, overthinking, knowledge gaps, and premature prioritization of definitive treatment over intermediate care. Crucially, reasoning length correlated with accuracy - shorter responses (<5,000 characters) were more reliable, suggesting extended explanations may signal uncertainty or rationalization of errors. While DeepSeek R1 exhibits foundational clinical reasoning capabilities, recurring flaws highlight critical areas for refinement, including bias mitigation, knowledge updates, and structured reasoning frameworks. These findings underscore LLMs' potential to augment medical decision-making through artificial reasoning but emphasize the need for domain-specific validation, interpretability safeguards, and confidence metrics (e.g., response length thresholds) to ensure reliability in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

This high performance makes it increasingly difficult to meaningfully evaluate and differentiate advanced methods. We present MedAgentsBench, a benchmark that focuses on challenging medical questions requiring multi-step clinical reasoning, diagnosis formulation, and treatment planning-scenarios where current models still struggle despite their strong performance on standard tests. Drawing from seven established medical datasets, our benchmark addresses three key limitations in existing evaluations: (1) the prevalence of straightforward questions where even base models achieve high performance, (2) inconsistent sampling and evaluation protocols across studies, and (3) lack of systematic analysis of the interplay between performance, cost, and inference time. Through experiments with various base models and reasoning methods, we demonstrate that the latest thinking models, DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI o3, exhibit exceptional performance in complex medical reasoning tasks. Additionally, advanced search-based agent methods offer promising performance-to-cost ratios compared to traditional approaches. Our analysis reveals substantial performance gaps between model families on complex questions and identifies optimal model selections for different computational constraints.

Although Medical Visual Language Models (VLMs) show promise for radiological tasks, most existing VLMs merely produce final answers without revealing the underlying reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce MedVLM-R1, a medical VLM that explicitly generates natural language reasoning to enhance transparency and trustworthiness. Instead of relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which often suffers from overfitting to training distributions and fails to foster genuine reasoning, MedVLM-R1 employs a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the model to discover human-interpretable reasoning paths without using any reasoning references. Despite limited training data (600 visual question answering samples) and model parameters (2B), MedVLM-R1 boosts accuracy from 55.11% to 78.22% across MRI, CT, and X-ray benchmarks, outperforming larger models trained on over a million samples. It also demonstrates robust domain generalization under out-of-distribution tasks. By unifying medical image analysis with explicit reasoning, MedVLM-R1 marks a pivotal step toward trustworthy and interpretable AI in clinical practice.

We advance the previously demonstrated diagnostic capabilities of the Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE) through a new LLM-based agentic system optimised for clinical management and dialogue, incorporating reasoning over the evolution of disease and multiple patient visit encounters, response to therapy, and professional competence in medication prescription. To ground its reasoning in authoritative clinical knowledge, AMIE leverages Gemini's long-context capabilities, combining in-context retrieval with structured reasoning to align its output with relevant and up-to-date clinical practice guidelines and drug formularies. In a randomized, blinded virtual Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) study, AMIE was compared to 21 primary care physicians (PCPs) across 100 multi-visit case scenarios designed to reflect UK NICE Guidance and BMJ Best Practice guidelines. AMIE was non-inferior to PCPs in management reasoning as assessed by specialist physicians and scored better in both preciseness of treatments and investigations, and in its alignment with and grounding of management plans in clinical guidelines. To benchmark medication reasoning, we developed RxQA, a multiple-choice question benchmark derived from two national drug formularies (US, UK) and validated by board-certified pharmacists. While AMIE and PCPs both benefited from the ability to access external drug information, AMIE outperformed PCPs on higher difficulty questions. While further research would be needed before real-world translation, AMIE's strong performance across evaluations marks a significant step towards conversational AI as a tool in disease management.</p></details> | <details><summary>62 pa...</summary><p>62 pages, 7 figures in main text, 36 figures in appendix</p></details> |

Despite showing promise on multiple-choice tests, LLMs frequently struggle with open-ended medical questions, producing responses with dangerous hallucinations or lacking comprehensive coverage of critical aspects. Existing approaches attempt to address these challenges through domain-specific fine-tuning, but this proves resource-intensive and difficult to scale across models. To improve the comprehensiveness and factuality of medical responses, we propose a novel approach utilizing structured medical reasoning. Our method guides LLMs through an seven-step cognitive process inspired by clinical diagnosis, enabling more accurate and complete answers without additional training. Experiments on the MedLFQA benchmark demonstrate that our approach achieves the highest Factuality Score of 85.8, surpassing fine-tuned models. Notably, this improvement transfers to smaller models, highlighting the method's efficiency and scalability. Our code and datasets are available.</p></details> |  |

While prior work on RLVR has primarily focused on mathematical and coding domains, its applicability to other tasks and domains remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate whether medical reasoning can emerge from RLVR. We introduce Med-RLVR as an initial study of RLVR in the medical domain leveraging medical multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) data as verifiable labels. Our results demonstrate that RLVR is not only effective for math and coding but also extends successfully to medical question answering. Notably, Med-RLVR achieves performance comparable to traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on in-distribution tasks while significantly improving out-of-distribution generalization, with an 8-point accuracy gain. Further analysis of training dynamics reveals that, with no explicit reasoning supervision, reasoning emerges from the 3B-parameter base model. These findings underscore the potential of RLVR in domains beyond math and coding, opening new avenues for its application in knowledge-intensive fields such as medicine.</p></details> |  |

However, their deployment in healthcare, especially in disease reasoning tasks, is hindered by the challenge of acquiring expert-level cognitive data. In this paper, we introduce Citrus, a medical language model that bridges the gap between clinical expertise and AI reasoning by emulating the cognitive processes of medical experts. The model is trained on a large corpus of simulated expert disease reasoning data, synthesized using a novel approach that accurately captures the decision-making pathways of clinicians. This approach enables Citrus to better simulate the complex reasoning processes involved in diagnosing and treating medical conditions. To further address the lack of publicly available datasets for medical reasoning tasks, we release the last-stage training data, including a custom-built medical diagnostic dialogue dataset. This open-source contribution aims to support further research and development in the field. Evaluations using authoritative benchmarks such as MedQA, covering tasks in medical reasoning and language understanding, show that Citrus achieves superior performance compared to other models of similar size. These results highlight Citrus potential to significantly enhance medical decision support systems, providing a more accurate and efficient tool for clinical decision-making.</p></details> |  |

MedXpertQA includes 4,460 questions spanning 17 specialties and 11 body systems. It includes two subsets, Text for text evaluation and MM for multimodal evaluation. Notably, MM introduces expert-level exam questions with diverse images and rich clinical information, including patient records and examination results, setting it apart from traditional medical multimodal benchmarks with simple QA pairs generated from image captions. MedXpertQA applies rigorous filtering and augmentation to address the insufficient difficulty of existing benchmarks like MedQA, and incorporates specialty board questions to improve clinical relevance and comprehensiveness. We perform data synthesis to mitigate data leakage risk and conduct multiple rounds of expert reviews to ensure accuracy and reliability. We evaluate 16 leading models on MedXpertQA. Moreover, medicine is deeply connected to real-world decision-making, providing a rich and representative setting for assessing reasoning abilities beyond mathematics and code. To this end, we develop a reasoning-oriented subset to facilitate the assessment of o1-like models.</p></details> |  |

However, prior models that rely on pre-training or supervised fine-tuning often exhibit low data efficiency and limited practicality in real-world clinical applications. While OpenAI's o1 highlights test-time scaling in mathematics, attempts to replicate this approach in medicine typically distill responses from GPT-series models to open-source models, focusing primarily on multiple-choice tasks. This strategy, though straightforward, neglects critical concerns like data privacy and realistic deployment in clinical settings. In this work, we present a deployable, small-scale medical reasoning system, MedS3, designed for long-chain reasoning in clinical tasks using a self-evolution paradigm. Starting with a seed dataset of around 8,000 instances spanning five domains and 16 datasets, we prompt a base policy model to perform Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to construct rule-verifiable reasoning chains. Each reasoning step is assigned an evolution rollout value, allowing verified trajectories to train the policy model and the process reward model (PRM). During inference, the policy model generates multiple responses, and the reward model selects the one with a newly proposed PRM-guided Vote-Sum (P-VS) strategy. Experiments on eleven evaluation datasets demonstrate that MedS3 outperforms not only the prior strongest medical model by 6.59, but also 32B-level general reasoning models by 8.71 points.

However, most existing medical LLMs struggle with the advanced reasoning required for complex clinical scenarios, such as differential diagnosis or personalized treatment suggestions. We proposed FineMedLM-o1, which leverages high-quality synthetic medical data and long-form reasoning data for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), enabling advanced dialogue and deep reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we introduced Test-Time Training (TTT) in the medical domain for the first time, facilitating domain adaptation and ensuring reliable, accurate reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that FineMedLM-o1 achieves a 23% average performance improvement over prior models on key medical benchmarks. Furthermore, the introduction of TTT provides an additional 14% performance boost, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing medical reasoning capabilities. To support this process, we also proposed a novel method for synthesizing medical dialogue. Compared to other open-source datasets, our dataset stands out as superior in both quality and complexity. The project and data will be released on GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[Limitations of Large Language Models in Clinical Problem-Solving Arising from Inflexible Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04381v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have attained human-level accuracy on medical question-answer (QA) benchmarks. However, their limitations in navigating open-ended clinical scenarios have recently been shown, raising concerns about the robustness and generalizability of LLM reasoning across diverse, real-world medical tasks. To probe potential LLM failure modes in clinical problem-solving, we present the medical abstraction and reasoning corpus (M-ARC). M-ARC assesses clinical reasoning through scenarios designed to exploit the Einstellung effect -- the fixation of thought arising from prior experience, targeting LLM inductive biases toward inflexible pattern matching from their training data rather than engaging in flexible reasoning. We find that LLMs, including current state-of-the-art o1 and Gemini models, perform poorly compared to physicians on M-ARC, often demonstrating lack of commonsense medical reasoning and a propensity to hallucinate. In addition, uncertainty estimation analyses indicate that LLMs exhibit overconfidence in their answers, despite their limited accuracy. The failure modes revealed by M-ARC in LLM medical reasoning underscore the need to exercise caution when deploying these models in clinical settings.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |
| **[O1 Replication Journey -- Part 3: Inference-time Scaling for Medical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06458v1)** | 2025-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building upon our previous investigations of O1 replication (Part 1: Journey Learning [Qin et al., 2024] and Part 2: Distillation [Huang et al., 2024]), this work explores the potential of inference-time scaling in large language models (LLMs) for medical reasoning tasks, ranging from diagnostic decision-making to treatment planning. Through extensive experiments on medical benchmarks of varying complexity (MedQA, Medbullets, and JAMA Clinical Challenges), our investigation reveals several key insights: (1) Increasing inference time does lead to improved performance. With a modest training set of 500 samples, our model yields substantial performance improvements of 6%-11%. (2) Task complexity directly correlates with the required length of reasoning chains, confirming the necessity of extended thought processes for challenging problems. (3) The differential diagnoses generated by our model adhere to the principles of the hypothetico-deductive method, producing a list of potential conditions that may explain a patient's symptoms and systematically narrowing these possibilities by evaluating the evidence. These findings demonstrate the promising synergy between inference-time scaling and journey learning in advancing LLMs' real-world clinical reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tree-based RAG-Agent Recommendation System: A Case Study in Medical Test Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02727v1)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present HiRMed (Hierarchical RAG-enhanced Medical Test Recommendation), a novel tree-structured recommendation system that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for intelligent medical test recommendations. Unlike traditional vector similarity-based approaches, our system performs medical reasoning at each tree node through a specialized RAG process. Starting from the root node with initial symptoms, the system conducts step-wise medical analysis to identify potential underlying conditions and their corresponding diagnostic requirements. At each level, instead of simple matching, our RAG-enhanced nodes analyze retrieved medical knowledge to understand symptom-disease relationships and determine the most appropriate diagnostic path. The system dynamically adjusts its recommendation strategy based on medical reasoning results, considering factors such as urgency levels and diagnostic uncertainty. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in terms of coverage rate, accuracy, and miss rate compared to conventional retrieval-based methods. This work represents a significant advance in medical test recommendation by introducing medical reasoning capabilities into the traditional tree-based retrieval structure.</p></details> |  |
| **[HuatuoGPT-o1, Towards Medical Complex Reasoning with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18925v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The breakthrough of OpenAI o1 highlights the potential of enhancing reasoning to improve LLM. Yet, most research in reasoning has focused on mathematical tasks, leaving domains like medicine underexplored. The medical domain, though distinct from mathematics, also demands robust reasoning to provide reliable answers, given the high standards of healthcare. However, verifying medical reasoning is challenging, unlike those in mathematics. To address this, we propose verifiable medical problems with a medical verifier to check the correctness of model outputs. This verifiable nature enables advancements in medical reasoning through a two-stage approach: (1) using the verifier to guide the search for a complex reasoning trajectory for fine-tuning LLMs, (2) applying reinforcement learning (RL) with verifier-based rewards to enhance complex reasoning further. Finally, we introduce HuatuoGPT-o1, a medical LLM capable of complex reasoning, which outperforms general and medical-specific baselines using only 40K verifiable problems. Experiments show complex reasoning improves medical problem-solving and benefits more from RL. We hope our approach inspires advancements in reasoning across medical and other specialized domains.</p></details> |  |

LLMs' ability to coalesce vast amounts of information from many sources to generate a response-a process similar to that of a human expert-has led many to see potential in deploying LLMs for clinical use. However, medicine is a setting where accurate reasoning is paramount. Many researchers are questioning the effectiveness of multiple choice question answering (MCQA) benchmarks, frequently used to test LLMs. Researchers and clinicians alike must have complete confidence in LLMs' abilities for them to be deployed in a medical setting. To address this need for understanding, we introduce a knowledge graph (KG)-based method to evaluate the biomedical reasoning abilities of LLMs. Essentially, we map how LLMs link medical concepts in order to better understand how they reason. We test GPT-4, Llama3-70b, and PalmyraMed-70b, a specialized medical model. We enlist a panel of medical students to review a total of 60 LLM-generated graphs and compare these graphs to BIOS, a large biomedical KG. We observe GPT-4 to perform best in our human review but worst in our ground truth comparison; vice-versa with PalmyraMed, the medical model. Our work provides a means of visualizing the medical reasoning pathways of LLMs so they can be implemented in clinical settings safely and effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings paper presented at Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) symposium 2024, December 15-16, 2024, Vancouver, Canada, 19 pages</p></details> |

RARE incorporates two innovative actions within the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework: A6, which generates search queries based on the initial problem statement, performs information retrieval using those queries, and augments reasoning with the retrieved data to formulate the final answer; and A7, which leverages information retrieval specifically for generated sub-questions and re-answers these sub-questions with the relevant contextual information. Additionally, a Retrieval-Augmented Factuality Scorer is proposed to replace the original discriminator, prioritizing reasoning paths that meet high standards of factuality. Experimental results with LLaMA 3.1 show that RARE enables open-source LLMs to achieve competitive performance with top open-source models like GPT-4 and GPT-4o. This research establishes RARE as a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains where logical coherence and factual integrity are critical.</p></details> | 24 pages, 8 figures |

However, this common approach of task-specific fine-tuning is costly and necessitates separate models for each downstream task, limiting the exploration of zero-shot capabilities. In this paper, we introduce MC-CoT, a modular cross-modal collaboration Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework designed to enhance the zero-shot performance of MLLMs in Med-VQA by leveraging large language models (LLMs). MC-CoT improves reasoning and information extraction by integrating medical knowledge and task-specific guidance, where LLM provides various complex medical reasoning chains and MLLM provides various observations of medical images based on instructions of the LLM. Our experiments on datasets such as SLAKE, VQA-RAD, and PATH-VQA show that MC-CoT surpasses standalone MLLMs and various multimodality CoT frameworks in recall rate and accuracy. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating background information and detailed guidance in addressing complex zero-shot Med-VQA tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 14 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

We present CliMedBench, a comprehensive benchmark with 14 expert-guided core clinical scenarios specifically designed to assess the medical ability of LLMs across 7 pivot dimensions. It comprises 33,735 questions derived from real-world medical reports of top-tier tertiary hospitals and authentic examination exercises. The reliability of this benchmark has been confirmed in several ways. Subsequent experiments with existing LLMs have led to the following findings: (i) Chinese medical LLMs underperform on this benchmark, especially where medical reasoning and factual consistency are vital, underscoring the need for advances in clinical knowledge and diagnostic accuracy. (ii) Several general-domain LLMs demonstrate substantial potential in medical clinics, while the limited input capacity of many medical LLMs hinders their practical use.

In this work, we propose MedAdapter, a unified post-hoc adapter for test-time adaptation of LLMs towards biomedical applications. Instead of fine-tuning the entire LLM, MedAdapter effectively adapts the original model by fine-tuning only a small BERT-sized adapter to rank candidate solutions generated by LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that MedAdapter effectively adapts both white-box and black-box LLMs in biomedical reasoning, achieving average performance improvements of 25.48% and 11.31%, respectively, without requiring extensive computational resources or sharing data with third parties. MedAdapter also yields superior performance when combined with train-time adaptation, highlighting a flexible and complementary solution to existing adaptation methods. Faced with the challenges of balancing model performance, computational resources, and data privacy, MedAdapter provides an efficient, privacy-preserving, cost-effective, and transparent solution for adapting LLMs to the biomedical domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in EMNLP 2024 main conference</p></details> |

However, most models in medical field are unimodal single tasks and lack good generalizability and explainability. In this study, we introduce MedViLaM, a unified vision-language model towards a generalist model for medical data that can flexibly encode and interpret various forms of medical data, including clinical language and imaging, all using the same set of model weights. To facilitate the creation of such multi-task model, we have curated MultiMedBench, a comprehensive pretaining dataset and benchmark consisting of several distinct tasks, i.e., continuous question-answering, multi-label disease classification, disease localization, generation and summarization of radiology reports. MedViLaM demonstrates strong performance across all MultiMedBench tasks, frequently outpacing other generalist models by a significant margin. Additionally, we present instances of zero-shot generalization to new medical concepts and tasks, effective transfer learning across different tasks, and the emergence of zero-shot medical reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompting Large Language Models for Supporting the Differential Diagnosis of Anemia](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15377v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In practice, clinicians achieve a diagnosis by following a sequence of steps, such as laboratory exams, observations, or imaging. The pathways to reach diagnosis decisions are documented by guidelines authored by expert organizations, which guide clinicians to reach a correct diagnosis through these sequences of steps. While these guidelines are beneficial for following medical reasoning and consolidating medical knowledge, they have some drawbacks. They often fail to address patients with uncommon conditions due to their focus on the majority population, and are slow and costly to update, making them unsuitable for rapidly emerging diseases or new practices. Inspired by clinical guidelines, our study aimed to develop pathways similar to those that can be obtained in clinical guidelines. We tested three Large Language Models (LLMs) -Generative Pretrained Transformer 4 (GPT-4), Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), and Mistral -on a synthetic yet realistic dataset to differentially diagnose anemia and its subtypes. By using advanced prompting techniques to enhance the decision-making process, we generated diagnostic pathways using these models. Experimental results indicate that LLMs hold huge potential in clinical pathway discovery from patient data, with GPT-4 exhibiting the best performance in all conducted experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[MEDIC: Towards a Comprehensive Framework for Evaluating LLMs in Clinical Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07314v1)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) for healthcare applications has spurred calls for holistic evaluation beyond frequently-cited benchmarks like USMLE, to better reflect real-world performance. While real-world assessments are valuable indicators of utility, they often lag behind the pace of LLM evolution, likely rendering findings obsolete upon deployment. This temporal disconnect necessitates a comprehensive upfront evaluation that can guide model selection for specific clinical applications. We introduce MEDIC, a framework assessing LLMs across five critical dimensions of clinical competence: medical reasoning, ethics and bias, data and language understanding, in-context learning, and clinical safety. MEDIC features a novel cross-examination framework quantifying LLM performance across areas like coverage and hallucination detection, without requiring reference outputs. We apply MEDIC to evaluate LLMs on medical question-answering, safety, summarization, note generation, and other tasks. Our results show performance disparities across model sizes, baseline vs medically finetuned models, and have implications on model selection for applications requiring specific model strengths, such as low hallucination or lower cost of inference. MEDIC's multifaceted evaluation reveals these performance trade-offs, bridging the gap between theoretical capabilities and practical implementation in healthcare settings, ensuring that the most promising models are identified and adapted for diverse healthcare applications.</p></details> | Technical report |

Methods: We used 300 gastroenterology board exam-style multiple-choice questions, 138 of which contain images to systematically assess the impact of model configurations and parameters and prompt engineering strategies utilizing GPT-3.5. Next, we assessed the performance of proprietary and open-source LLMs (versions), including GPT (3.5, 4, 4o, 4omini), Claude (3, 3.5), Gemini (1.0), Mistral, Llama (2, 3, 3.1), Mixtral, and Phi (3), across different interfaces (web and API), computing environments (cloud and local), and model precisions (with and without quantization). Finally, we assessed accuracy using a semiautomated pipeline. Results: Among the proprietary models, GPT-4o (73.7%) and Claude3.5-Sonnet (74.0%) achieved the highest accuracy, outperforming the top open-source models: Llama3.1-405b (64%), Llama3.1-70b (58.3%), and Mixtral-8x7b (54.3%). Among the quantized open-source models, the 6-bit quantized Phi3-14b (48.7%) performed best. The scores of the quantized models were comparable to those of the full-precision models Llama2-7b, Llama2--13b, and Gemma2-9b. Notably, VLM performance on image-containing questions did not improve when the images were provided and worsened when LLM-generated captions were provided. In contrast, a 10% increase in accuracy was observed when images were accompanied by human-crafted image descriptions. Conclusion: In conclusion, while LLMs exhibit robust zero-shot performance in medical reasoning, the integration of visual data remains a challenge for VLMs. Effective deployment involves carefully determining optimal model configurations, encouraging users to consider either the high performance of proprietary models or the flexible adaptability of open-source models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript Pages: 34, Figures: 7, Tables: 2, Supplementary File Pages: 35, Data Transparency Statement: Code is available at: https://github.com/Sdamirsa/LLM-VLM-in-Gastroenterology .

| **[Improving Medical Reasoning through Retrieval and Self-Reflection with Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15269v3)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent proprietary large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, have achieved a milestone in tackling diverse challenges in the biomedical domain, ranging from multiple-choice questions to long-form generations. To address challenges that still cannot be handled with the encoded knowledge of LLMs, various retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods have been developed by searching documents from the knowledge corpus and appending them unconditionally or selectively to the input of LLMs for generation. However, when applying existing methods to different domain-specific problems, poor generalization becomes apparent, leading to fetching incorrect documents or making inaccurate judgments. In this paper, we introduce Self-BioRAG, a framework reliable for biomedical text that specializes in generating explanations, retrieving domain-specific documents, and self-reflecting generated responses. We utilize 84k filtered biomedical instruction sets to train Self-BioRAG that can assess its generated explanations with customized reflective tokens. Our work proves that domain-specific components, such as a retriever, domain-related document corpus, and instruction sets are necessary for adhering to domain-related instructions. Using three major medical question-answering benchmark datasets, experimental results of Self-BioRAG demonstrate significant performance gains by achieving a 7.2% absolute improvement on average over the state-of-the-art open-foundation model with a parameter size of 7B or less. Overall, we analyze that Self-BioRAG finds the clues in the question, retrieves relevant documents if needed, and understands how to answer with information from retrieved documents and encoded knowledge as a medical expert does. We release our data and code for training our framework components and model weights (7B and 13B) to enhance capabilities in biomedical and clinical domains.</p></details> | ISMB 2024 |
| **[MedAgents: Large Language Models as Collaborators for Zero-shot Medical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10537v4)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs), despite their remarkable progress across various general domains, encounter significant barriers in medicine and healthcare. This field faces unique challenges such as domain-specific terminologies and reasoning over specialized knowledge. To address these issues, we propose MedAgents, a novel multi-disciplinary collaboration framework for the medical domain. MedAgents leverages LLM-based agents in a role-playing setting that participate in a collaborative multi-round discussion, thereby enhancing LLM proficiency and reasoning capabilities. This training-free framework encompasses five critical steps: gathering domain experts, proposing individual analyses, summarising these analyses into a report, iterating over discussions until a consensus is reached, and ultimately making a decision. Our work focuses on the zero-shot setting, which is applicable in real-world scenarios. Experimental results on nine datasets (MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, and six subtasks from MMLU) establish that our proposed MedAgents framework excels at mining and harnessing the medical expertise within LLMs, as well as extending its reasoning abilities. Our code can be found at https://github.com/gersteinlab/MedAgents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inquire, Interact, and Integrate: A Proactive Agent Collaborative Framework for Zero-Shot Multimodal Medical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11640v1)** | 2024-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The adoption of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare has attracted significant research interest. However, their performance in healthcare remains under-investigated and potentially limited, due to i) they lack rich domain-specific knowledge and medical reasoning skills; and ii) most state-of-the-art LLMs are unimodal, text-only models that cannot directly process multimodal inputs. To this end, we propose a multimodal medical collaborative reasoning framework \textbf{MultiMedRes}, which incorporates a learner agent to proactively gain essential information from domain-specific expert models, to solve medical multimodal reasoning problems. Our method includes three steps: i) \textbf{Inquire}: The learner agent first decomposes given complex medical reasoning problems into multiple domain-specific sub-problems; ii) \textbf{Interact}: The agent then interacts with domain-specific expert models by repeating the ``ask-answer'' process to progressively obtain different domain-specific knowledge; iii) \textbf{Integrate}: The agent finally integrates all the acquired domain-specific knowledge to accurately address the medical reasoning problem. We validate the effectiveness of our method on the task of difference visual question answering for X-ray images. The experiments demonstrate that our zero-shot prediction achieves state-of-the-art performance, and even outperforms the fully supervised methods. Besides, our approach can be incorporated into various LLMs and multimodal LLMs to significantly boost their performance.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior LLM works in healthcare focusing on tasks like question answering, our work specifically focuses on long multi-turn voice conversations. Our one-trillion parameter constellation system is composed of several multibillion parameter LLMs as co-operative agents: a stateful primary agent that focuses on driving an engaging conversation and several specialist support agents focused on healthcare tasks performed by nurses to increase safety and reduce hallucinations. We develop a sophisticated training protocol for iterative co-training of the agents that optimize for diverse objectives. We train our models on proprietary data, clinical care plans, healthcare regulatory documents, medical manuals, and other medical reasoning documents. We align our models to speak like medical professionals, using organic healthcare conversations and simulated ones between patient actors and experienced nurses. This allows our system to express unique capabilities such as rapport building, trust building, empathy and bedside manner. Finally, we present the first comprehensive clinician evaluation of an LLM system for healthcare. We recruited over 1100 U.S. licensed nurses and over 130 U.S. licensed physicians to perform end-to-end conversational evaluations of our system by posing as patients and rating the system on several measures. We demonstrate Polaris performs on par with human nurses on aggregate across dimensions such as medical safety, clinical readiness, conversational quality, and bedside manner. Additionally, we conduct a challenging task-based evaluation of the individual specialist support agents, where we demonstrate our LLM agents significantly outperform a much larger general-purpose LLM (GPT-4) as well as from its own medium-size class (LLaMA-2 70B).</p></details> |  |

For this purpose, we comprehensively evaluated both open-source LLMs and Google's new multimodal LLM called Gemini across Medical reasoning, hallucination detection, and Medical Visual Question Answering tasks. While Gemini showed competence, it lagged behind state-of-the-art models like MedPaLM 2 and GPT-4 in diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, Gemini achieved an accuracy of 61.45\% on the medical VQA dataset, significantly lower than GPT-4V's score of 88\%. Our analysis revealed that Gemini is highly susceptible to hallucinations, overconfidence, and knowledge gaps, which indicate risks if deployed uncritically. We also performed a detailed analysis by medical subject and test type, providing actionable feedback for developers and clinicians. To mitigate risks, we applied prompting strategies that improved performance.

However, these models face a significant challenge when it comes to sensitive applications, such as reasoning over medical knowledge and answering medical questions in a physician-like manner. Prior studies attempted to overcome this challenge by increasing the model size (>100B) to learn more general medical knowledge, while there is still room for improvement in LLMs with smaller-scale model sizes (<100B). In this work, we start from a pre-trained general LLM model (AntGLM-10B) and fine-tune it from a medical beginner towards a medical expert (called AntGLM-Med-10B), which leverages a 3-stage optimization procedure, i.e., general medical knowledge injection, medical domain instruction tuning, and specific medical task adaptation. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We specifically investigate how to adapt a pre-trained general LLM in medical domain, especially for a specific medical task. (2) We collect and construct large-scale medical datasets for each stage of the optimization process. These datasets encompass various data types and tasks, such as question-answering, medical reasoning, multi-choice questions, and medical conversations. (3) Specifically for multi-choice questions in the medical domain, we propose a novel Verification-of-Choice approach for prompting engineering, which significantly enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs. Remarkably, by combining the above approaches, our AntGLM-Med-10B model can outperform the most of LLMs on PubMedQA, including both general and medical LLMs, even when these LLMs have larger model size.</p></details> | <details><summary>Devel...</summary><p>Developed by Ant Group for PubMedQA leaderboard</p></details> |

Generalist biomedical artificial intelligence (AI) systems that flexibly encode, integrate, and interpret this data at scale can potentially enable impactful applications ranging from scientific discovery to care delivery. To enable the development of these models, we first curate MultiMedBench, a new multimodal biomedical benchmark. MultiMedBench encompasses 14 diverse tasks such as medical question answering, mammography and dermatology image interpretation, radiology report generation and summarization, and genomic variant calling. We then introduce Med-PaLM Multimodal (Med-PaLM M), our proof of concept for a generalist biomedical AI system. Med-PaLM M is a large multimodal generative model that flexibly encodes and interprets biomedical data including clinical language, imaging, and genomics with the same set of model weights. Med-PaLM M reaches performance competitive with or exceeding the state of the art on all MultiMedBench tasks, often surpassing specialist models by a wide margin. We also report examples of zero-shot generalization to novel medical concepts and tasks, positive transfer learning across tasks, and emergent zero-shot medical reasoning. To further probe the capabilities and limitations of Med-PaLM M, we conduct a radiologist evaluation of model-generated (and human) chest X-ray reports and observe encouraging performance across model scales. In a side-by-side ranking on 246 retrospective chest X-rays, clinicians express a pairwise preference for Med-PaLM M reports over those produced by radiologists in up to 40.50% of cases, suggesting potential clinical utility. While considerable work is needed to validate these models in real-world use cases, our results represent a milestone towards the development of generalist biomedical AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in complex reasoning tasks in various fields, such as mathematics, logic, and commonsense QA, they still need to improve with the increased complexity and specialization of the medical field. This is because medical CQA tasks require not only strong medical reasoning, but also the ability to think broadly and deeply. In this paper, to address these challenges in medical CQA tasks that need to be considered and understood in many aspects, we propose the Holistically Thought (HoT) method, which is designed to guide the LLMs to perform the diffused and focused thinking for generating high-quality medical responses. The proposed HoT method has been evaluated through automated and manual assessments in three different medical CQA datasets containing the English and Chinese languages. The extensive experimental results show that our method can produce more correctness, professional, and considerate answers than several state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, manifesting its effectiveness.

| **[Capabilities of GPT-4 on Medical Challenge Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13375v2)** | 2023-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation across various domains, including medicine. We present a comprehensive evaluation of GPT-4, a state-of-the-art LLM, on medical competency examinations and benchmark datasets. GPT-4 is a general-purpose model that is not specialized for medical problems through training or engineered to solve clinical tasks. Our analysis covers two sets of official practice materials for the USMLE, a three-step examination program used to assess clinical competency and grant licensure in the United States. We also evaluate performance on the MultiMedQA suite of benchmark datasets. Beyond measuring model performance, experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of test questions containing both text and images on model performance, probe for memorization of content during training, and study probability calibration, which is of critical importance in high-stakes applications like medicine. Our results show that GPT-4, without any specialized prompt crafting, exceeds the passing score on USMLE by over 20 points and outperforms earlier general-purpose models (GPT-3.5) as well as models specifically fine-tuned on medical knowledge (Med-PaLM, a prompt-tuned version of Flan-PaLM 540B). In addition, GPT-4 is significantly better calibrated than GPT-3.5, demonstrating a much-improved ability to predict the likelihood that its answers are correct. We also explore the behavior of the model qualitatively through a case study that shows the ability of GPT-4 to explain medical reasoning, personalize explanations to students, and interactively craft new counterfactual scenarios around a medical case. Implications of the findings are discussed for potential uses of GPT-4 in medical education, assessment, and clinical practice, with appropriate attention to challenges of accuracy and safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 15 figures; added GPT-4-base model results and discussion</p></details> |
| **[Hybrid Classic-Quantum Computing for Staging of Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of Breast](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10142v1)** | 2023-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the great current relevance of Artificial Intelligence, and the extraordinary innovations that this discipline has brought to many fields -among which, without a doubt, medicine is found-, experts in medical applications of Artificial Intelligence are looking for new alternatives to solve problems for which current Artificial Intelligence programs do not provide with optimal solutions. For this, one promising option could be the use of the concepts and ideas of Quantum Mechanics, for the construction of quantum-based Artificial Intelligence systems. From a hybrid classical-quantum perspective, this article deals with the application of quantum computing techniques for the staging of Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the breast. It includes: (1) a general explanation of a classical, and well-established, approach for medical reasoning, (2) a description of the clinical problem, (3) a conceptual model for staging invasive ductal carcinoma, (4) some basic notions about Quantum Rule-Based Systems, (5) a step-by-step explanation of the proposed approach for quantum staging of the invasive ductal carcinoma, and (6) the results obtained after running the quantum system on a significant number of use cases. A detailed discussion is also provided at the end of this paper.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Information (ISSN 2078-2489)</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Models Encode Clinical Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13138v1)** | 2022-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, but the quality bar for medical and clinical applications is high. Today, attempts to assess models' clinical knowledge typically rely on automated evaluations on limited benchmarks. There is no standard to evaluate model predictions and reasoning across a breadth of tasks. To address this, we present MultiMedQA, a benchmark combining six existing open question answering datasets spanning professional medical exams, research, and consumer queries; and HealthSearchQA, a new free-response dataset of medical questions searched online. We propose a framework for human evaluation of model answers along multiple axes including factuality, precision, possible harm, and bias. In addition, we evaluate PaLM (a 540-billion parameter LLM) and its instruction-tuned variant, Flan-PaLM, on MultiMedQA. Using a combination of prompting strategies, Flan-PaLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on every MultiMedQA multiple-choice dataset (MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, MMLU clinical topics), including 67.6% accuracy on MedQA (US Medical License Exam questions), surpassing prior state-of-the-art by over 17%. However, human evaluation reveals key gaps in Flan-PaLM responses. To resolve this we introduce instruction prompt tuning, a parameter-efficient approach for aligning LLMs to new domains using a few exemplars. The resulting model, Med-PaLM, performs encouragingly, but remains inferior to clinicians. We show that comprehension, recall of knowledge, and medical reasoning improve with model scale and instruction prompt tuning, suggesting the potential utility of LLMs in medicine. Our human evaluations reveal important limitations of today's models, reinforcing the importance of both evaluation frameworks and method development in creating safe, helpful LLM models for clinical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing Pre-Trained Language Models for Disease Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07285v1)** | 2021-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained language models such as ClinicalBERT have achieved impressive results on tasks such as medical Natural Language Inference. At first glance, this may suggest that these models are able to perform medical reasoning tasks, such as mapping symptoms to diseases. However, we find that standard benchmarks such as MedNLI contain relatively few examples that require such forms of reasoning. To better understand the medical reasoning capabilities of existing language models, in this paper we introduce DisKnE, a new benchmark for Disease Knowledge Evaluation. To construct this benchmark, we annotated each positive MedNLI example with the types of medical reasoning that are needed. We then created negative examples by corrupting these positive examples in an adversarial way. Furthermore, we define training-test splits per disease, ensuring that no knowledge about test diseases can be learned from the training data, and we canonicalize the formulation of the hypotheses to avoid the presence of artefacts. This leads to a number of binary classification problems, one for each type of reasoning and each disease. When analysing pre-trained models for the clinical/biomedical domain on the proposed benchmark, we find that their performance drops considerably.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2021 Findings</p></details> |
| **[Medical idioms for clinical Bayesian network development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00364v2)** | 2020-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian Networks (BNs) are graphical probabilistic models that have proven popular in medical applications. While numerous medical BNs have been published, most are presented fait accompli without explanation of how the network structure was developed or justification of why it represents the correct structure for the given medical application. This means that the process of building medical BNs from experts is typically ad hoc and offers little opportunity for methodological improvement. This paper proposes generally applicable and reusable medical reasoning patterns to aid those developing medical BNs. The proposed method complements and extends the idiom-based approach introduced by Neil, Fenton, and Nielsen in 2000. We propose instances of their generic idioms that are specific to medical BNs. We refer to the proposed medical reasoning patterns as medical idioms. In addition, we extend the use of idioms to represent interventional and counterfactual reasoning. We believe that the proposed medical idioms are logical reasoning patterns that can be combined, reused and applied generically to help develop medical BNs. All proposed medical idioms have been illustrated using medical examples on coronary artery disease. The method has also been applied to other ongoing BNs being developed with medical experts. Finally, we show that applying the proposed medical idioms to published BN models results in models with a clearer structure.</p></details> |  |

We adapted a boosted Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) framework to learn probabilistic rules from clinical hospital records for the management of physiologic parameters of children with severe cardiac or respiratory failure who were managed with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. In this preliminary study, the results were promising. In particular, the algorithm returned logic rules for medical actions that are consistent with medical reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 1 figure, presented at the 2020 AAAI StarAI workshop</p></details> |
| **[Resolving Conflicts in Clinical Guidelines using Argumentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07526v1)** | 2019-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatically reasoning with conflicting generic clinical guidelines is a burning issue in patient-centric medical reasoning where patient-specific conditions and goals need to be taken into account. It is even more challenging in the presence of preferences such as patient's wishes and clinician's priorities over goals. We advance a structured argumentation formalism for reasoning with conflicting clinical guidelines, patient-specific information and preferences. Our formalism integrates assumption-based reasoning and goal-driven selection among reasoning outcomes. Specifically, we assume applicability of guideline recommendations concerning the generic goal of patient well-being, resolve conflicts among recommendations using patient's conditions and preferences, and then consider prioritised patient-centered goals to yield non-conflicting, goal-maximising and preference-respecting recommendations. We rely on the state-of-the-art Transition-based Medical Recommendation model for representing guideline recommendations and augment it with context given by the patient's conditions, goals, as well as preferences over recommendations and goals. We establish desirable properties of our approach in terms of sensitivity to recommendation conflicts and patient context.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted for publication at AAAMAS 2019</p></details> |
